# Quake 4: The Awakening on openQ4

The Awakening is the Quake 4 expansion Raven Software and Ritual Entertainment
never released. Justin Marshall recovered and published its alpha. openQ4 plays
its single-player campaign from your copy of that content, using openQ4's own
engine and game code. It never loads the expansion's leaked game DLL, and
openQ4 ships none of the expansion's files.

This page lists what openQ4 changes to make the campaign run and play as it was
built. To install the content and choose the campaign, see
[Campaigns](campaigns.md).

## At a glance

- All 13 campaign maps load, play through and save, from the trenches of
  Stranarus to the Valkaryne's lair.
- Every new monster, weapon and vehicle is rebuilt in openQ4's game code: the
  Pain Lord, the Valkaryne, the Tank, the Retch and the walker; the goob,
  freeze and spike guns; the speeder bike and the dropship and MCC cannons.
- Where the alpha's own code or content stopped something working as designed,
  openQ4 fixes it. The Valkaryne finale, the beach's death-ray turret, the Pain
  Lord's weak spot and Retches that could never move are the biggest examples
  (see [Fixes to the alpha](#fixes-to-the-alpha)).
- The alpha is unfinished. Some sounds, effects, models and scripted voice-over
  are missing from the content itself (see [Known issues in the
  alpha](#known-issues-in-the-alpha)).
- The campaign works with openQ4's other features. VR seats you in the
  expansion's turrets and on its speeder bike.
- Multiplayer is not part of this integration. Multiplayer always runs on stock
  Quake 4 content.

## Running the campaign

What openQ4 changed so the expansion's content loads at all:

- **Campaign choice.** Single Player → Campaign offers The Awakening once
  openQ4 finds its content. Choosing it mounts the expansion (`q4xbase`) and
  restarts the filesystem, so its overrides never leak into Quake 4, Arena or
  multiplayer. Its saves and settings live apart, under `fs_savepath/q4xbase`.
  `fs_awakeningpath` points openQ4 at content kept outside the Quake 4 folder.
- **Retail definitions kept.** The expansion ships files with retail's names
  (`def/debris.def`, `def/ai/persona.def`, `sound/music.sndshd` and others)
  that would replace retail's whole file. openQ4 also reads the retail file
  underneath, so the 239 definitions they would hide survive: debris in death
  effects, marine chatter and the menu music.
- **New file formats.** Version 2 collision models (the expansion's model clip
  hulls), DXT3 textures, textures named `.jpg` that only exist as `.tga` (the
  Valkaryne's limbs), and music under `sound/music/`, which now follows the
  music volume.
- **Menus and controls.** The menu commands its interface uses
  (`GetCVarValue`, `SetCVarValue`, `GetVecCVarValue`) work, and its
  `_altattack` binding is the alternate-fire button.
- **Ten new script events** for its levels: docking the Valkaryne, the Pain
  Lord's processing machine, the speeder bike's speed, gravity and boost, and
  two control-point queries.
- **Saves.** The expansion's marines have up to 540 animations, more than the
  256 openQ4's saves allowed for retail's models (at most 244), so a game saved
  on the prison level (m04) never loaded. It does now, on every campaign map.
- **A quieter log.** Flares in the Valkaryne's lair (m09) are not the single
  quads the flare effect expects, which logged a warning hundreds of times a
  second; openQ4 now warns once per material.

## What openQ4 rebuilt

| Element | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Fire vents (`func_fire_volume`) | m01, m01 part 2, m02, m03, m04 | Burn whoever touches them. Only the freeze gun puts them out, dimming their firelight as they shrink. |
| Walker | m01, m01 part 2, m06 invasion | A marine walker on your side; it fights the Strogg with its cannon and rockets. |
| Retch | m01 part 2, m02, m04, m05, m08 | Buffs a Strogg ally's damage or defence with a beam, fires lightning and dodges. |
| Tank | m02, m04, m08, m09 | Railgun, machine gun and shoulder rockets behind armour. Break its launcher to stop the rockets and its chest plate to reach its heart, which takes six times the damage. |
| Pain Lord | m05 | A boss who works a marine-processing machine. Two half-processed marines on his back shield him; he is stunned at two thirds and one third of his health, and enraged when the marines are torn off. If he finishes his third processing, Strauss dies and the mission fails. |
| Valkaryne | m08 (set piece), m09 | Docked on her platform she is untouchable and fires death-ray volleys; on foot she uses her railguns, grenades, rockets and claws. |
| Goob gun | m02 on | Its globs burn what they hit, and burst into six smaller globs. Its flamethrower mod adds a short-range alternate fire. |
| Freeze gun | player arsenal | Chills enemies until they slow, freezes them solid as they die, and shatters them. Its ammo regenerates. |
| Spike gun | player arsenal | Spikes stick where they land, stay in the enemies they kill and pin the bodies to the wall behind. Its scope mod fires explosive spikes. |
| Turrets | m01, m01 part 2, m04, m05 | Tighten their aim the longer they fire, pause before re-firing, and security cameras sweep. |
| Speeder bike | m06 invasion, the three m07 races | Hover bike with a gun and a crouch-activated boost. |
| Dropship and MCC cannons | m03, m06 invasion | Pulse cannon that overheats, and a missile launcher whose rockets lock on and home. |
| Scripted targets | m03, m04, m06, m07, m09 | Set pieces name the only enemies an AI may fight (`onlyTarget`), so scripted battles stay on script. |

Rebuilding these went down to the details the levels rely on, matching the
alpha's own code:

- **Enemies.** Elite grunts pull you in with a gravity well, elite gunners
  spray their fire, and tactical elites throw grenades. The Tank scatters its
  rockets once its launcher smokes, plays its own break effects, and loses its
  rockets when either armoured part breaks. Space flyers (m03) follow their
  attack runs instead of turning to face you, climbing, diving and banking with
  them, and the fighters of m03 and m06 bank into their turns.
- **Weapons.** The goob gun bursts into its six globs and shows its
  flamethrower's flame, with your character holding the flamethrower's pose.
  Spikes knock bodies back towards the wall they pin them to, and keep their
  launch orientation in flight.
- **Vehicles.** The dropship and MCC cannons keep their gunner from harm,
  recentre when you leave, and freeze during m03's scripted ammo jam. Their
  pulse cannon's barrels kick back with every shot and fold out of the way while
  the missiles are selected; the cannon keeps cooling and the launcher keeps
  reloading while you use the other weapon. The speeder bike turns, grips and
  hovers as built: a held turn holds steady, the bike reaches racing speed, and
  it keeps itself off walls and tunnel ceilings. The race tracks' rough edges
  (m07) slow it, their damage going to its shield. The races are against the
  clock: if a lockdown gate closes before you get past it, the mission fails.
- **Displays.** The race clock counts down on the speeder bike's HUD (m07), the
  MCC's health shows on the MCC cannon's (m06), the bike's dashboard shows your
  speed, the dropship status panel's view cone turns with your view (m03), and
  the crosshair shows when a marine is too busy to talk.

## Fixes to the alpha

The alpha's own code or content kept these from working as designed. openQ4
fixes them:

- **The Valkaryne finale (m09).** Her docking script was never run, so she
  never took her platform: she wandered harmlessly and could be killed before
  the Makron sphere, skipping the fight built around it. She now docks behind
  the sphere's shields and fires death-ray volleys, with about two seconds of
  warning; the arena's pillars give cover. When the sphere dies she undocks and
  fights on foot, and her death starts the escape.
- **The beach's death-ray turret (m01 part 2)** is meant to bombard the
  landing, never you. It no longer turns on you after the turrets beside it,
  a sound or a hit draw its attention.
- **The Pain Lord's head.** His definition makes headshots count double, but
  listed his legs over the whole body, so in the alpha every headshot counted
  as a leg hit (three quarters damage). Headshots now count.
- **The Retch** asks for navigation data that two levels lack (Trianfac and
  Stranarus Trench part 2), so four of them could never move. They now walk.
- **The goob gun's burning effect** shows from the first hit; the alpha looked
  it up in the wrong place.

## Deliberate differences from the alpha

openQ4 departs from the alpha's behaviour in a few places, to keep your
settings or to keep the game fair:

- **Your field of view is yours.** The alpha's m03 gun scripts and the speeder
  bike's boost rewrote your FOV setting. openQ4 applies those changes to the
  view only and never touches the setting.
- **Burns merge.** In the alpha one goob shot could light up to eight separate
  fires on one enemy, about 350 damage. Each enemy now carries one burn, which
  later hits feed up to three times its strength.
- **The Retch's fallback.** Where a level lacks the Retch's own navigation
  data, it uses the next size down, which its body fits.
- **An overheating pulse cannon says so.** The alpha's overheat signal reached
  none of the cannon's screens; openQ4 shows their JAMMED warning while it
  cools, and never clears the scripted ammo jam's warning early.
- **The ammo-jam lock and banking flight paths** apply only in The Awakening.
  Stock Quake 4 vehicles and flight paths are unchanged.
- **Multiplayer-only content stays out.** The vampiric gauntlet mod belongs to
  the expansion's multiplayer arsenal and has no effect in the campaign.

## Known issues in the alpha

These are holes in the expansion's content itself; no code change can supply
them, and openQ4 ships no replacement assets:

- Some voice-over never plays: thirteen scripted voice-over files are never
  loaded by the expansion's own scripts.
- About 100 sound references, a handful of in-map screens, effects, models and
  one teleport-dropper animation are missing from the content.
- m09's Valkaryne arena script shows and hides a force field and shield pieces
  the map does not contain, and the Tank's rocket flash names a joint its
  model lacks. Both only lose an effect. m09's frosty-breath effects name a
  joint only marines have, and two of its triggers call script functions the
  developers commented out or never wrote.
- m04's starting inventory names a goob-gun mod that does not exist, and the
  m08 and m09 developer give lists contain typos. m08's first-lab scientists
  call a script function (`FirstLabCleared`) the map never defines; nothing
  waits on it.
- The background harvester in the m07 races is retail's cinematic one, which
  has no turning animations. openQ4 no longer has it try to turn, which flooded
  the log and cost it its attacks.
- On the first race map (`m07_race1`) the navigation data for its scripted
  gunner and fighters is empty, so they stay where they are placed.
- The expansion's code also has a grapple hook, a concussion gun, a gravity-gun
  turret and a speeder-bike spline tether, but nothing in its campaign gives or
  places them, so openQ4 does not implement them. The objective compass is
  switched off in the expansion's own HUD.

## For modders and testers

The keys openQ4 honours in Awakening content (none appears in retail Quake 4,
so stock behaviour is unchanged):

| Key | On | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `requestDocking` | Valkaryne | Script function she runs the first time she has an enemy (any namespace). |
| `ignoreplayer` | AI | Never takes the player as an enemy, by any route. |
| `q4xElite` | grunt, gunner | Gravity well (`gravityWellTime`) or spread fire. |
| `grenadedelay` | tactical elites | Milliseconds between offhand grenades (needs a `throw_grenade` animation). |
| `canturn`, `noFaceEnemy` | Strogg flyer | Keep a flyer on its spline's heading. |
| `useMasterPitch`, `useMasterRoll` | bound AI | Climb, dive and bank with the mover it is bound to. |
| `impactEntity` | projectile | The burst it spawns on impact (also read as `def_impactEntity`). |
| `impactForce`, `applyRotation` | projectile | Push on what it hits; keep the launch orientation. |
| `fx_altmuzzleflash`, `useAltFireAnim` | weapon | Alternate-fire muzzle flash and player torso pose. |
| `useGodMode`, `resetOnExit` | vehicle | Protect the gunner; recentre turrets when the gunner leaves. |
| `allowDisableMovement` | vehicle turret | `0` keeps a turret turning while its vehicle's movement is disabled. |
| `velscale` | `trigger_hurt` | Scales the speed of what it hurts. |
| `traceRelativeDirection` | hover pad | Probe along a direction in the vehicle's frame. |
| `g_splineRollLookahead`, `g_splineRollMultiplier` (settings) | spline movers | How far ahead a mover facing along its spline looks to bank into a turn (500 is five spline points), and how hard it banks (2.0). |

A vehicle also passes script `guiEvent` and `setGuiParm` calls to its HUD as
well as its world screens, as the expansion's code did. The pulse cannon moves
its vehicle's `pulse_cannon_l` and `pulse_cannon_r` joints; a vehicle without
them fires the same, with still barrels.

Cheat commands and settings that help when testing the campaign without input:

- `openq4_testInput <ms> [attack] [zoom] [run] [crouch] [jump] [forward|back|right|left <0-127>] [aim <entity>] [yaw|pitch <deg/s>] [impulse <n>]`
  holds input on the local player for a stretch of game time, including a
  gunner's turret aim and weapon choice.
- `openq4_viewReport` prints your view, field of view and god mode.
- `ai_debugActions <name|*>` prints an AI's actions and attacks, and the
  Awakening's docking, buffs, armour breaks and freezing.
- `damage <entity> <amount> [damage def] [joint]` hits an entity, in a chosen
  joint's damage zone.
- `g_debugVehicle 1` reports the cannons' overheating and missile lock;
  `g_debugDamage 1` reports damage and burns.

The development record, with the evidence behind each change, is the
[support plan](../dev/plans/q4x-awakening.md); the original gap analysis is the
[support audit](../dev/q4x-awakening-support-audit.md).
