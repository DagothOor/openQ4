# TrueType font system

openQ4 can render GUI text from scalable TrueType faces instead of the retail
Quake 4 bitmap atlases. This document covers both halves: the generator that
builds the font files, and the engine path that draws with them.

This is the **default** path as of this release. `r_useTrueTypeFonts 0` returns
to the bitmap atlases, byte-for-byte unchanged, and is the fallback whenever the
`.ttf` files are absent.

## Why

The retail fonts are fixed 12/24/48 point atlases drawn onto a 640x480 virtual
canvas. Every display above that resolution scales the atlas up, so text gets
softer the higher the display resolution goes — at 1440p the 48 point atlas is
being magnified 3x. The TrueType path rasterises the same letterforms at the
resolution the display actually uses, so text stays crisp.

## The font files

`content/baseoq4/pak0/fonts/*.ttf` — one face per retail bitmap font:

| File | Family | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chain.ttf` | openQ4 Chain | Wide squarish techno sans; the default UI face |
| `lowpixel.ttf` | openQ4 LowPixel | Neo-grotesque, used for dense HUD readouts |
| `marine.ttf` | openQ4 Marine | All caps; radio and objective text |
| `profont.ttf` | openQ4 ProFont | Rounded technical face |
| `r_strogg.ttf` | openQ4 Roman Strogg | Angular oblique Strogg-Roman |
| `strogg.ttf` | openQ4 Strogg | Alien runes; Latin only by design |
| `bigchars.ttf` | openQ4 BigChars | Console and loading screen; monospaced, traced from the fixed-cell sheet |

Every face except `strogg` maps roughly 2,950 codepoints: ASCII, Latin-1, Latin
Extended-A/B, Vietnamese, Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic (including the
Presentation Forms-B joined shapes), Hebrew, punctuation, currency, arrows and
geometric shapes. `strogg.ttf` deliberately covers only the Latin runes it was
drawn for, folding accented letters onto their base rune.

## Generator

`tools/assets/fonts/` rebuilds the whole set from an installed copy of the game.

```bash
python tools/assets/fonts/extract_source_fonts.py --install "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Quake 4/q4base" --output .tmp/fontsrc
```

```bash
python tools/assets/fonts/build_openq4_fonts.py --source .tmp/fontsrc --donors .tmp/fontdonors --output content/baseoq4/pak0/fonts
```

The donor directory needs `NotoSans-var.ttf`, `NotoSansArabic-var.ttf` and
`NotoSansHebrew-var.ttf` from the Google Fonts repository, alongside their
`OFL.txt`.

### Pipeline

1. **Trace.** The 48 point atlas is the highest-fidelity source. Marching squares
   recovers the 50% iso-contour, but the crossing position is computed from the
   coverage value itself rather than by interpolating between two samples — a
   coverage sample *is* the exact area of a unit pixel inside the glyph, so it
   localises the edge directly. Interpolating against a saturated neighbour
   biases every edge outward by up to ~0.08px, which shows up as a halo.
2. **Corner detection and run fitting.** The contour is split at genuine corners,
   and each stretch between two corners is classified as a whole. Straightness is
   judged as a ratio of run length, not an absolute distance: a 30px stem edge
   drifts ~0.008 of its length while a 36 degree arc bulges ~0.08 of its chord,
   so the two never overlap.
3. **Axis snapping.** Near-axis lines are forced onto the axis and their offsets
   clustered, so both edges of a stem share one coordinate. Adjacent straight
   runs are intersected to restore corners the antialiasing rounded off.
4. **Marks.** Diacritics are lifted out of the retail precomposed glyphs (the
   acute out of `Á`, the cedilla out of `Ç`, and so on), and caron, macron,
   dot-above and double-acute are derived from those. A shallow acute is
   narrowed before it is doubled, or the two strokes of `ő` run together. The
   comma below, the turned comma of `ģ` and the dot below come from the face's
   own comma and dot; the comma is sized to end at the face's descender depth,
   as Noto's does. The breve and the ogonek sit on no Latin-1 letter, so they
   come from the weight-matched donor instance (step 9); a mark is small, and
   the letter under it stays authentic. When a capital's accent cannot be
   lifted cleanly (see below), the face's lowercase accent is reused at half
   the lowercase clearance, the angular ones a fifth flatter.
5. **Letters.** Turkish dotless `ı`, `ȷ`, the stroked `Ł ł Đ đ Ħ ħ Ŧ ŧ`, `Ĳ ĳ`,
   `ŉ` and `Ŀ ŀ` are built from the face's own letters plus a stroke, or minus
   a dot.
6. **Composition.** Latin-1 (where a face rebuilds it), Latin Extended-A/B and
   Vietnamese are then built as base plus mark, so they are authentic Quake 4
   shapes rather than imports. Accents go on the dotless `ı` and `ȷ`; `ď ť ľ Ľ`
   take an apostrophe beside the stem rather than a caron on the ascender, as
   Czech and Slovak write them; a second accent stacks on the first (`ǘ`, `ǟ`).
7. **Shape sharing.** Cyrillic and Greek letters that are identical to a Latin
   one — А В Е К М Н О Р С Т Х, Α Β Ε Ζ Η Ι Κ Μ Ν Ο Ρ Τ Υ Χ and the lowercase
   equivalents — reuse the traced Quake 4 outline, so most of any Cyrillic or
   Greek run stays in the real face. Cyrillic PE and U are *not* shared: PE is a
   pi shape, not an N, and both cases of U carry a descending tail.
8. **Symbols.** The Latin-1 symbols every retail atlas left blank - NBSP, the
   soft hyphen, `¢ ¦ ¨ ª ¬ ¯ ± ² ³ ¶ ¸ ¹ º ¼ ½ ¾` - are built from the face's own
   glyphs: superscripts and fractions from its digits, the ordinals from a
   raised `a` and `o` over a rule, spacing accents from its marks.
9. **Donors.** Whatever is left comes from Noto. Because the donors are variable
   fonts, each one is instantiated at the weight and width whose stem-to-cap
   ratio already matches the target face, rather than being distorted after the
   fact. The solved instances differ per face — Chain lands on 737/88, ProFont on
   450/85 — which is what keeps the imported scripts at the right colour. In an
   all-caps face (`marine`, `r_strogg`) the lowercase slots are small capitals,
   so a donor lowercase letter is replaced by the donor's capital at the small
   capitals' height, from an instance solved for their stem weight.
10. **Synthesis.** Noto Sans carries almost nothing from the arrows, geometric and
    misc-symbol blocks, so those are constructed directly at the face's weight.
11. **The console cell.** `bigchars` is fitted last: every glyph is pressed into
    the 16x16 cell the console clips to, and given the cell as its advance.

Small sources get an extra step first. Step 1 places an edge from the coverage
value itself, treating a sample as the area of a pixel cut by *one* edge. That
holds at 48 point, where a stem spans several pixels, but not on the 16 pixel
console cells, where a single pixel is usually cut by both sides of a stem at
once — there the assumption breaks down and contours come out lumpy, with
counters closing up and `@` collapsing into a blob. Any source below
`DENSIFY_TARGET_SIZE` (64px) is therefore resampled up to roughly that size
before tracing, which separates the two edges into different pixels and restores
the assumption. Bilinear is the right reconstruction: the sheet is antialiased,
so the coverage ramp already encodes where the edge sits.

The tracer's geometric thresholds (corner window, trims, minimum line length)
are fractions of an em, so they scale with the traced size. Its fitting
tolerances are not: they absorb antialiasing noise, which is a fraction of a
*source* pixel whatever the size. Scaled with the resampled size they shrank to
a twenty-fifth of a console pixel, so every kink bilinear leaves at a pixel
boundary was traced as a notch, and the console's octagonal bevels came out as
staircases. They are held at their reference value in source pixels instead,
and the resampled contour gets two smoothing passes; bevels, diagonals and the
round digits now trace clean.

### Fidelity

The generator scores every traced glyph by rasterising it and comparing against
the retail coverage it models. Across the six faces the mean absolute coverage
error is 0.4–0.8% with total area within 0.3% of the source, which means the
outlines reproduce the originals rather than merely resembling them.

### Defects in the retail data

The generator repairs these deliberately rather than trace them faithfully;
each one is listed in the face's `FaceSpec` in `build_openq4_fonts.py`.

- `chain`'s space glyph has a **zero advance** in all three retail point sizes,
  which collapses every gap in a line of text drawn in that face. Every other
  face uses exactly half an em. The generator substitutes half an em and reports
  `space_repaired=1`, so text in `chain` is spaced differently under
  `r_useTrueTypeFonts 1` than under `0`.
- Every atlas fills the **bullet** with a solid cap-high missing-glyph box. It
  is rebuilt from the face's middle dot.
- `profont`'s **`©`, `®` and `%`** were cut off at the left when Raven rendered
  the atlas, and are rebuilt from the face's `C`, `R`, `o` and `/`.
- The all-caps faces draw **sharp s as `B`** (`marine`, `r_strogg`). As a small
  capital it is written `SS`.
- Neither the 48 point ProFont atlas nor the 16 pixel console cells left room
  above a capital, so Raven ran the **capital accents into the letters**, and on
  the console also shortened every accented letter by a row. Lifted out, those
  accents come away as a sliver fused to a piece of the letter, or as the hole
  of a ring without the ring. The generator detects such marks and recomposes
  the accented letters: the capitals in `profont`, every accented Latin-1 letter
  in `bigchars`, whose accents come from its spacing circumflex, grave, tilde
  and degree ring and the dot of its `i`.
- The **console sheet slips around 0xDD**: Y-acute's cell holds the sharp s,
  and the thorn and sharp s cells hold stray copies of a-grave and a-acute, so
  every German `ß` on the console drew as `á`. The cells are remapped.
- The console sheet fills the unassigned Windows-1252 byte 0x81 with a solid
  block. Unassigned bytes are C1 control codes, which no face maps, so they draw
  as an empty cell.

### Auditing

`tools/assets/fonts/audit_fonts.py` scores a built set against the retail
atlases:

```bash
python tools/assets/fonts/audit_fonts.py --source .tmp/fontsrc --fonts content/baseoq4/pak0/fonts --output .tmp/fontaudit --sheets
```

Every traced glyph is rasterised back into its atlas cell and compared with the
retail coverage: IoU, pixels that visibly disagree, ink topology and advance.
Glyphs with no retail source are checked structurally (specks, empty outlines,
ink outside the line, and accents that run into their letter), the required
character set is checked against every cmap, and `--sheets` renders specimen
sheets for the eye. Rebuilt and remapped cells are left out of the fidelity
scores, since they differ from the retail art on purpose.

The retail atlases cannot ship, so CI runs `tools/tests/ttf_font_integrity.py`
instead, which needs only the font files: coverage, no visible character drawn
empty, no C1 control mapped, no two accented letters with the same drawing
(the console's sharp s slip), and every `bigchars` glyph inside the console
cell.

## Engine

- `src/renderer/TrueType.h/.cpp` — a self-contained TrueType reader and
  rasteriser. It handles `glyf` outlines (simple and composite), format 4 and 12
  character maps, horizontal metrics and legacy `kern` pairs. There is no
  third-party dependency: the project keeps its dependency surface small, and a
  font file is untrusted input that is easier to bounds-check in-tree. Every
  read goes through a range-checked reader, so a truncated or hostile file
  yields zeroes rather than reading past the end.
  The rasteriser accumulates exact per-pixel signed area per edge and integrates
  along each scanline, so coverage is analytically correct without supersampling.
- `src/renderer/tr_fontTTF.cpp` — rasterises U+0020–U+00FF into the 256 base
  glyph slots for each of the three point sizes, packs them into a glyph atlas
  and fills the same `fontInfo_t` the bitmap loader produces. Because the metric
  units and UV conventions are identical, nothing downstream needs to know which
  path produced the font. Everything above U+00FF goes into a second atlas of
  sparse code-point pages hung off the same `fontInfo_t`; see
  [text-encoding-and-localization.md](text-encoding-and-localization.md). The
  struct gained an indexing tag and a page pointer for that, and is mirrored
  into `openQ4-game`.

The atlas is rasterised at the display's own upscale factor
(`displayHeight / 480`), clamped to 6x. Atlas pages are RGBA8 with white colour
and coverage in alpha, matching the retail atlases so the GUI blend path is
unchanged. Each glyph gets a transparent gutter wide enough to absorb the
bleed guard `DeviceContext` applies when sampling.

### Matching the bitmap fonts' size

The point of the exercise is text that is *sharper*, not text that is bigger,
smaller or differently spaced, so the sizing is held to the retail atlases in
two separate places.

**The ink.** Measured against the retail coverage, traced glyph extents land
within a few percent of the atlas they model across all six faces and all three
point sizes — the residual is the retail bitmap's own texel quantisation, which
is 4 visual units per texel at 12 point. Advances are exact: every printable
ASCII codepoint in every face reproduces the retail advance to the unit, so a
string occupies the same width either way. The single exception is `chain`'s
space, covered above.

**The rect.** A retail `.fontdat` records each glyph as its ink plus a one texel
border on every side, and one retail texel is one metric unit. The GUI reads
those rects back as `glyph.width`/`glyph.height`, and they are not merely the
drawn quad: `DrawText` derives its line spacing from `maxHeight`, the character
cell it fits text into from `maxWidth`, and `TextHeight` from the tallest glyph
in the string. So the border has to be one *metric unit*, which is `upscale`
texels here, not the one texel the rasteriser leaves. Reporting the rasteriser's
border instead makes the metrics shrink as the rasterisation scale rises — the
same font reports a different cell at 1080p and at 1440p — and put GUI text a
few pixels above where the bitmap path puts it. The atlas gutter covers this
border as well as the bleed guard.

`maxWidth`/`maxHeight` also skip the Windows-1252 punctuation band, 0x80–0x9F.
The retail atlases leave much of it blank — `chain` and `profont` carry an empty
2x2 rect for the florin, per mille, em dash and ellipsis, and `chain` gives them
a zero advance as well — so the generator fills those slots from a donor face.
Those donor glyphs are wider and taller than anything the retail font could
draw: letting the per mille sign set `profont`'s layout cell inflated it by 62%.
Measuring the repertoire the GUIs were authored against brings both extents to
within 6% of retail for every face and size at 1080p and above, tightening as
resolution rises. What is left is the rasteriser rounding the ink out to whole
texels, which is the same quantisation the retail bitmaps carry.

Two size divergences are left on purpose. `chain`'s repaired space makes any
string containing one about 10% wider than the retail atlas draws it, which is
the point of the repair. And the faces declare real `ascender`/`descender`
values where several retail fonts declare wrong ones — `marine` reports a font
height 66% larger — which is harmless because GUI layout reads neither field;
see the text-background section for what does use them.

That display height comes from **`glConfig`, not `engineWindowState`**. The
latter is the engine-owned window mirror the module polls at present time: at
font-registration time it still holds the pre-mode logical window size, and its
UI viewport is never populated on this path at all. Reading it produced an
upscale of 1.5 on a 1440p display instead of 3.0, so every atlas was rasterised
at half the resolution the display needed and text stayed softer than it should
have been.

Font atlases follow the renderer restart lifecycle. A full `vid_restart`
releases cached TrueType faces before image purge, retains atlas coverage while
generated images rebuild with the new context, reinitialises the font reader, and immediately
rebuilds the console sheet. A successful partial restart keeps the context,
faces, and images alive, but still refreshes the resolution-dependent console
sheet. Cached GUI fonts notice the renderer restart generation on their next
lookup or selection and re-register in place, preserving the integer indices
stored by parsed GUIs as well as the active font and size selection.

GUI, extended-character and console atlases retain one byte of coverage per
texel in CPU memory. Their image generator expands that coverage to white RGB
with alpha when storage is recreated, including `reloadImages all`. A scratch
allocation alone loses the glyph pixels and can leave Vulkan sampling an
undefined image. Re-registering a font replaces the retained coverage for its
new scale/codepage; final renderer shutdown frees it. This cache adds one
quarter of the atlas's RGBA8 GPU footprint in CPU memory.

Glyph area grows with the square of the scale, so a slot is capped at
`Q4_TTF_MAX_PAGE_AREA` (2048x2048, 16MB at RGBA8). The required area is
predicted from the glyph metrics, which needs no rasterising, and the slot's
scale is pulled back if it would not fit. The clamp only engages above 1440p,
where 3x is already past the point of visible return. A face at full resolution
costs roughly 16MB + 4MB + 1MB across its three sizes; `r_ttfFontResolution`
scales that quadratically for anyone who wants the memory back.

### The console sheet

The console and the loading screen never went through the font system: they
slice characters straight out of `bigchars`, a 16x16 grid of 16x16 pixel cells
indexed by byte, which is why console text was the blurriest text in the game.

`R_BuildConsoleFontAtlas` rebuilds that sheet at display resolution - same grid,
same cell indexing, just larger cells - and retargets the existing
`fonts/english/bigchars` material at it. Because the UV maths in
`Con_DrawSizedChar` is purely fractional (`0.0625` per cell), every caller keeps
working with no change to `Console.cpp` or `Common.cpp`, and no new renderer
interface. Glyphs are clipped to their own cell so nothing can bleed into a
neighbour.

`bigchars.ttf` is traced from that 16px sheet rather than borrowed from another
face - the closest existing face, `lowpixel`, scores a 0.16 shape difference
against it, which is nowhere near a match. Tracing 16px cells is inherently
coarser than the 48pt sources, but the sheet is genuinely antialiased (174
distinct coverage levels), so the sub-pixel edge localisation has real signal to
work with and the result is a clean vector rather than a magnified block.

It carries the same extended coverage as the other faces, and its advances are
forced to one em. The source is a fixed-cell font and both consumers step a
fixed cell per character, ignoring font advances entirely, so a proportional
advance would be fiction — which is what the donor-imported scripts arrive
carrying. The console still indexes by byte, so it reaches the 224 characters
of the active language's codepage (Windows-1250, -1251, -1252 or -1254) rather
than the whole file; that is how Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Turkish and Cyrillic
console text draws.

Only two of a cell's sixteen pixel rows lie above a capital and two below the
baseline, and the sheet clips each glyph to its cell. Capital accents are
therefore pressed into those two rows, gap and mark together, and a donor
letter that would reach past the cell is compressed above its cap height or
below its baseline. At 1080p the cell is 36 pixels, so a capital accent is
still about four pixels tall.

### Keeping the atlas materials alive

Each atlas is bound through a material this module generates at registration
time. Those declarations have no `.mtr` behind them, which makes them fragile in
a way a shipped material is not.

The material and its intrinsic generated image intentionally use the same
`_ttfatlas...` identity. The declaration manager parses a newly requested
implicit material before the font module can replace its source, and that
implicit stage maps an image named after the material. Sharing the already
uploaded atlas identity makes this first parse valid and prevents spurious
missing-image warnings and redundant defaulted image records. The font module
then installs its full generated stage unconditionally so the required blend,
linear filtering, clamp, and no-picmip state remains explicit.

`idDeclManagerLocal::BeginLevelLoad` purges every declaration that is not marked
as parsed outside a level load, and `FindType` clears that mark on anything it
resolves *during* a load. A face a map's own GUIs are the first to name — the
Strogg terminal font is one, and it first appears partway through the campaign —
is registered inside that window, so it ends up classified as level media. For a
shipped material that costs nothing: the next reference reparses it from its
file. For a generated one there is no file, and the implicit text the manager
synthesises for a declaration with no source maps an image named after the
material itself, which nothing is registered under. That resolves to the default
image, which is **fully transparent outside developer builds**, so the failure
is not a missing-texture box — every glyph in the face silently draws nothing,
with no warning, and nothing short of a restart brings it back.

Two things close that off:

- `R_TTFInstallAtlasStage` calls `SetText` before parsing, so the declaration
  carries the generated source itself and a purge becomes recoverable. Implicit
  declarations are excluded from the network decl checksum, so this stays
  process local — a graphical client does not gain a declaration a dedicated
  server can never create.
- `idRenderSystemLocal::BeginLevelLoad` calls `R_TTFRestoreAtlasMaterials`,
  which runs immediately after the declaration purge and before the loading
  screen draws its first frame of text. It looks each material up *without*
  parsing first, so a healthy declaration costs nothing and is not demoted by
  the lookup itself.

Registration is also self-healing: `R_TTFCreateAtlasMaterial` always reinstalls
the complete generated stage. This is intentionally stronger than comparing
the old stage's image name, because a full renderer restart can recreate the
image manager while leaving a generated declaration carrying a stale image
pointer.

A related hazard sits on the GUI side. `idDeviceContext` holds `activeFont` and
`useFont` as pointers into its `fonts` list, and that list has granularity 1, so
`FindFont` reallocates it on every registration. `idWindow::SetFont` re-points
`activeFont` before each draw, but nothing re-points `useFont`, and `DrawText`
reads it through `MaxCharWidth`/`MaxCharHeight` *before* `SetFontByScale`
reselects it — so the character cell and line skip the whole layout is built
from would be read out of a freed allocation. `FindFont` reseats both pointers
by index across the append.

### Cvars

| Cvar | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `r_useTrueTypeFonts` | `1` | Draw GUI text from the `.ttf` faces |
| `r_ttfFontResolution` | `1.0` | Multiplier on atlas rasterisation resolution |
| `r_ttfFontDebug` | `0` | Dump each atlas to `fs_savepath/ttfatlas` and log its layout |

Changing `r_useTrueTypeFonts` takes effect the next time fonts are registered.

`uiFontParitySelfTest` asserts parity with the retail atlases — exact advances,
and that the radio font resolves to the marine atlas material. Those cases are
skipped when the TrueType path is active, since measuring a deliberately
different rasteriser against the retail one is a category error rather than a
regression. `tools/tests/renderer_validation_matrix.py` pins
`r_useTrueTypeFonts 0` for that case so the coverage is kept.

## Accessibility text background

Independent of which font path is active, `gui_textBackground` draws a solid
black backing behind each line of text so contrast no longer depends on what
happens to be underneath.

| Cvar | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gui_textBackground` | `0` | Backing opacity; 0 off, 1 opaque |
| `gui_textBackgroundPadding` | `2` | Padding past the text, in virtual units |

The box is drawn once per line before any glyph, so it never shows through the
gaps between characters, and colour escapes inside a line change the text colour
without affecting the backing.

Its height comes from the font's **measured glyph ink extents**, not from
`fontInfo_t`'s `ascender`/`descender`. Those fields do not describe where the ink
is: the retail marine font declares an ascender of 29.9 while its capitals reach
40.4, and declares no descender at all despite having glyphs 11 units below the
baseline. Measuring the glyphs also means every line of a given font gets the
same box height whatever characters it contains, so a wrapped paragraph does not
come out ragged. `uiFontParitySelfTest` covers both the extent measurement and
the rect placement.

## Known limitations

- **Cyrillic letters without a Latin twin come from Noto.** They are matched to
  each face's weight and width, but they are Noto's drawings, not Raven's.
- **Two accents on one console capital** (`Ȭ`, `Ǖ`) cannot both fit in the
  cell's two rows above a capital and run together. No shipped language uses
  them.
- `r_strogg`'s `Ç` and `ç` close a hairline gap the retail art leaves between
  the letter and the cedilla; at HUD sizes it is under a tenth of a pixel.

- **Text input above ASCII is not wired up.** Display is complete — engine text
  is UTF-8 and the text path draws by code point — but `idEditField` and the
  platform scan tables are still byte-oriented, so typing Cyrillic into the
  console or a chat box does not work.
- **No Arabic shaping or bidi.** The faces include the Presentation Forms-B
  joined shapes precisely so a shaper can use them, but no shaper exists yet.
  Until one does, Arabic coverage is not usable text.
- **The code-point page directory stops at the BMP.** Nothing the GUI draws
  lives above U+FFFF, and stopping there keeps the directory to 256 pointers per
  font size.
- Atlases are rebuilt only when fonts are registered; a resolution change does
  not currently re-rasterise them at the new upscale factor, so changing
  resolution wants a restart for text to be pixel-exact again.
- `FMT_ALPHA` would quarter atlas memory and is swizzled to RGB=1/A=R on both
  backends, but a `ScratchImage` in that format renders nothing through the GUI
  blend path. Unresolved; RGBA8 is used instead.
