# openQ4 UI Visual Design

Specification version 1.4, 27 September 2026 (1.1 to 1.3 on 26 September, 1.0
on 8 September 2026). Status:
implementation target; the replacement has not shipped. Applies to every
player-facing GUI and to the visual editor's Quake 4 preview. Implementation and
evidence are tracked in [the replacement plan](plans/idtech5-ui.md).

Version 1.1 added measured references from a survey of the effective retail
GUI scripts, interface art, fonts and materials, and corrected anatomy that did
not match them. Version 1.2 adds the [modern interface
direction](#13-modern-interface-direction): viewing profiles, adaptive layout,
controller, touch and Android behavior, and modern screen patterns. Version 1.3
measures the framing-band motion, the HUD and the pop-up frames, adds detailing
rules, a pop-up frame catalogue and modern components, and gives the HUD its
own [section](#14-hud-and-in-game-overlays), including the weapon wheel. Version
1.4 measures the objectives display, the boss, vehicle and scope displays and
the multiplayer HUD and scoreboard, gives the Strogg HUD its own weapon wheel,
and keeps the reticle grid, grain and light band to menu backdrops.
[Appendix C](#appendix-c-change-record) lists every change and the
requirement-register rows it affects.

## 1. Purpose, authority and reference

Deliver a high-definition, high-fidelity Quake 4 interface at every supported
display density and aspect ratio. Preserve the game's military instrument
character, information hierarchy, interactions and sound vocabulary. Replace
low-resolution interface furniture with authored vector geometry. Every menu,
HUD, terminal, scope, loading screen and vehicle display is in scope.

The user's `idtech5-ui` objective authorizes translating the entire GUI set
and replacing interface furniture with vector artwork. This supersedes the
old requirement to draw all furniture from retail bitmaps. It does not
authorize a different game's visual identity or bundling extracted retail art.
Existing bitmap references identify appearance, not implementation assets.
The [legacy guide](ui-legacy-gui-reference.md) records old layout conventions
and script traps for translators; it is not the replacement design contract.

Read this specification before composing a screen, component, icon or editor
preview. An unstyled prototype cannot establish visual completion.

### Source hierarchy

1. Installed Quake 4 PK4s, with their actual filesystem precedence, establish
   stock visuals, animation, behavior, fonts and sounds.
2. Repository `content/baseoq4/` changes establish openQ4's current features.
3. This specification establishes scalable geometry, density, layout, state and
   motion treatment while retaining both sets of behavior.
4. Existing engine-render-target captures establish comparison views. Record
   map, mode, state, language, renderer, resolution and capture command.

Use retail `guis/mainmenu.gui`, `guis/mpmain.gui`, settings pages and their
material references for the Marine menu family. Use each original HUD,
terminal and vehicle GUI for that family's distinct appearance. Do not apply
the Marine olive menu palette indiscriminately to Strogg and diegetic displays.

The effective copy of a stock file is the one in the last archive in load
order. `guis/mainmenu.gui` exists in nine retail archives, and the copy in
`pak025.pk4` wins. Survey the effective copy, never the first one found.

### Measuring stock sources

Stock GUIs author every rectangle on a 640x480 virtual canvas. Record stock
measurements in source units (`u`) on that canvas and convert them last: at
the 1280x720 dp reference, `1 u = 1.5 dp` on both axes. The stock 4:3 canvas
maps to the central 960x720 dp; aspect expansion supplies the remaining width.

- Interface bitmaps are stretched non-uniformly into window rectangles; a
  512x32 texel row plate is drawn at 377x25 u. Measure proportions in the
  texture (visible bounds, cut length, rail width, fade span) and scale them by
  the drawn rectangle. A proportion survives the stretch; a texel count does not.
- A `textscale` of `s` draws an em of `48 s` u, which is `72 s` dp at the
  reference, from the 12, 24 or 48 point atlas (`s` up to 0.30, up to 0.60,
  above). Take cap and x-heights from glyph ink: `.fontdat` rectangles include
  a one-texel border on every side.
- Record colors together with their material blend. The same texture looks
  different under `blend add` or a darkening blend (section 4).
- Record motion from `transition` durations (optional acceleration and
  deceleration fractions give the `accel` profile of section 8), absolute and
  `+N` relative `onTime` keys,
  `guitable_*` pulse tables, and material `scroll` and `rotate` stages.
- Record numbers and descriptions only. Extracted art, fonts and captures stay
  outside tracked source. [Appendix A](#appendix-a-stock-survey-method)
  describes the 1.1 survey.

## 2. Visual identity

Quake 4 menus resemble military instrumentation: dark translucent plates,
thin olive edge rails, 45-degree cuts, restrained highlights, technical labels
and warm orange interaction cues. The world and level imagery remain visible
behind the instrument layer. Interfaces are precise and compact without
being cramped. Decorative detail supports hierarchy or retains a specific
recognizable feature of the original.

Avoid pill buttons, rounded cards, large generic web headings, cartoon shadows,
rainbow gradients, gratuitous neon, indiscriminate glass blur and blank spacer
areas. A panel's shape, contents and ornament are deliberately composed. Do
not obtain fidelity by putting a low-resolution screenshot into a vector box.

### Recognition traits

These measured traits make an interface read as Quake 4. A reconstruction of
a stock screen that drops one of them is not visually complete.

1. **A lit instrument field.** The menu backdrop is dark scene imagery under an
   additive olive light band (peak `#616F26`, applied at 70%), black top and
   bottom vignettes, a `+` reticle grid on a 30 u (45 dp) pitch at 4% opacity
   and drifting static grain at about 2.4%.
2. **Framing bands.** Opaque black bands frame the screen. Their inner edges
   step through 45-degree risers and three raised notches, and a soft olive rim
   light traces every inner edge. The bands move between the home and page
   states.
3. **Open plates.** Action plates carry rails on the leading edge, the cut and
   the bottom edge only. There is no top rail, no trailing rail and no closed
   outline. Fill and bottom rail dissolve toward the trailing end.
4. **The lower-leading cut.** Every action plate loses its lower-leading corner
   to a 45-degree cut through roughly half of its visible height.
5. **The ◥ marker.** A small right triangle filling the upper-trailing half of
   its square, with a soft halo, precedes action labels inside their cap band.
   Flipped vertically, it marks sort direction.
6. **Two faces, graded text.** Marine small capitals carry navigation, actions
   and titles; Lowpixel carries rows, values, lists and body text. Labels are
   white at 80%, setting values amber-yellow at 80%, titles white at 50% and
   headings white at 40%.
7. **Warm, instant response.** Hover or focus turns label and marker orange,
   brightens the plate and grows the label about 3%, all at once. Value rows
   brighten only their plate. Release returns over 300 ms.
8. **Asymmetric panels.** Cards cut two diagonally opposite corners deeply and
   the other two slightly. Modals are dark silhouettes over an additive glow
   field, with a recessed title slot and a deep lower-leading chamfer.
9. **Meaningful color.** Faction marks, team colors and the weapon and item
   color code carry gameplay information and never serve as decoration.

### Divergences to avoid

The survey also found recurring departures from the stock vocabulary in newer
screens. Do not introduce them or carry them into the replacement:

- closed outlines around fields, rows or buttons, including bordered
  rectangles used as furniture;
- centered labels on action plates; stock action labels lead, after the marker;
- identical cuts on all four corners, rounded rectangles and pill shapes;
- a large page heading; the stock screen title is a quiet caption in the
  top band, and the navigation carries the hierarchy;
- orange setting values; orange means interaction, values are amber-yellow;
- text below the type ramp's floor (section 5);
- extra accent hues outside the family palette, such as a second orange;
- a flat gray-green panel fill where the stock uses black plates or
  olive-tinted light plates.

### Families

| Family | Identity | Required fidelity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Marine menus | Olive/black plates, orange focus, yellow values, Marine title face | Stepped/notched bands, open cut plates, triangular markers, additive light, original scene imagery |
| Marine HUD | Tactical overlays, bright critical values, compact instruments | Weapon/ammo/health/armor hierarchy, sheared gauges, feedback and original spatial relationships |
| Strogg HUD and terminals | Original alien glyphs, mechanical paths and family colors | Each source's geometry and animation; never generic Marine panels |
| World terminals | Local device panel and in-world illumination | Surface mapping, interaction targets, stateful scripts and intended viewing distance |
| Weapon displays | Gun-mounted ammo counters on green, amber and red state fields | Digit legibility at view-model distance, per-weapon art, state colors and pulse cadence |
| Objectives (PDA) | Pale-green open plates beside a leading-edge gradient bar | Objective imagery, entry cadence, notices, Marine and Strogg variants |
| Vehicles and turrets | Weapon-specific reticles, gauges and status | Cockpit alignment, targeting, damage and cooldown states |
| Scopes | Optical/technical marks in source shape and color | Exact aim center, FOV relationship, masks and tick cadence |
| Loading/cinematic overlays | Restrained frame, level identity and progress | Background composition, subtitle safe area, fades and cinematic bars |
| Credits and intros | Rune-to-Latin decode reveals, additive orange credit bars | Reveal choreography, rune/Latin pairing, logo light-up |
| Multiplayer overlays | Tactical tables with team and spectator identity | Score sorting, timers, join choices and authoritative match state |

Family tokens extend shared geometry, motion and interaction tokens. Their
colors and motifs must be measured from their sources and recorded in their
migration entries before implementation. An invented palette applied to all
terminals does not satisfy full GUI replacement.

### Family reference values

Measured from the effective sources named in each row. These values seed the
family tokens; individual terminals and vehicles still need per-source entries.

| Family (sources) | Measured palette | Type (stock `textscale`) | Geometry and motion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 3. Coordinates, density and aspect expansion

Author in density-independent design pixels (`dp`). Components use local
coordinates; documents use responsive layout constraints. Imported 640x480
coordinates are source measurements, not a permanent screen-sized render
target or a reason to stretch the completed interface.

The platform supplies window coordinates, drawable pixel dimensions, content
scale and the active UI viewport separately. For layout/render coordinates in
drawable pixels, `physicalPixels = dp * displayScale * userScale`; incoming
window coordinates first map to drawable pixels using pixel density. Do not
apply content scale twice. Include the viewport origin in the transform.
Use the inverse of the actual composed transform for hit testing.

| Setting | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| UI scale | Default 100%; player-adjustable 75–200%, independently persisted |
| Text scale | Default 100%; 100–200% independently of furniture; reflow labels/rows |
| Desktop reference | 1280x720 dp composition reference; never a raster framebuffer limit |
| Standard margins | 32 dp horizontally, 24 dp vertically; 16 dp in compact mode |
| Content maximum | 1440 dp for forms/tables; backgrounds and structural rails stay full bleed |
| Spacing scale | 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48 dp |
| Minimum interactive height | 36 dp desktop; 48 dp touch presentation (section 13) |
| Compact presentation | Available width below 960 dp or height below 600 dp; keep navigation, scroll bodies |
| Smallest qualification viewport | 640x480 physical at 100% scale; larger scale settings remain recoverable |

At wide aspect ratios, expand tables, allow two columns, extend framing and
separate navigation/content. Preserve stroke width, corner angles, circles
and glyph proportions. At 32:9, contain forms and body text to a comfortable
center region while imagery/framing reach the edges. At 4:3 or large text
scale, stack columns and scroll bodies. Essential actions cannot leave the
visible safe area. Section 13 adds viewing profiles for desk, couch, handheld
and Android presentation, refines the compact presentation into size classes
and defines safe-area rules for cutouts and system gestures.

HUD anchor groups expand toward the corresponding viewport edges, with a
player-selectable safe inset. Crosshairs, scopes and targeting markers remain
at the true gameplay projection center. HUD and menu scales are independent
where their ergonomic purposes differ. World-space GUIs use surface coordinates
and projected render density, not desktop physical sizing.

Monitor/DPI changes update layout, font density, vector tessellation, clipping
and cursor mapping together without reopening a menu. Resizing during a
transition preserves progress/current values. UI renders at output resolution
after world upscaling; dynamic world resolution cannot blur text or change
input targets. Clamping extreme scale settings must preserve a reachable reset.

### Stock grid

| Stock element | Source | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Canvas | 640x480 u | Central 960x720 dp |
| Navigation plate: pitch / visible plate | 30 / 24.4 u | 45 / 37 dp |
| Settings row: pitch / visible plate | 24 / 19.5 u | 36 / 29 dp |
| Action button (Back, Yes, No): rectangle / visible plate | 30 / 23.4 u | 45 / 35 dp |
| List row: standard / server browser | 20 / 18 u | 30 / 27 dp |
| Hover-card list row | 12–15 u | 18–22 dp |
| Background `+` grid pitch | 30 u | 45 dp |
| Stock hit strips: navigation / rows / Back | 26 / 20 / 23 u | 39 / 30 / 35 dp |

In every stock action list the visible plate fills about 80% of its pitch;
keep that ratio. The 36 dp minimum target equals the stock settings pitch.
Stock hit strips were separate windows shorter than the pitch; they are not a
precedent for smaller targets, and the replacement's target is the full pitch.

## 4. Color, alpha and contrast

These are sRGB authoring colors; alpha is independent. Renderer adapters must
agree on color conversion and premultiplication. Do not feed premultiplied
colors through straight-alpha blending.

| Token | sRGB hex / source value | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `marine.olive` | `#8B964B` / approximately 0.545, 0.588, 0.294 | Frame rails and plates |
| `marine.marker` | `#909A49` / approximately 0.564, 0.603, 0.286 | Triangle markers |
| `marine.orange` | `#E38900` / approximately 0.890, 0.537, 0 | Active interaction and selection |
| `surface.panel` | `#171C12` / 0.09, 0.11, 0.07 | Main plate, alpha 0.88 |
| `surface.inset` | `#090C08` | Fields/list troughs, alpha 0.90 |
| `text.primary` | `#FFFFFF`, alpha 0.80 | Normal title/button/body baseline |
| `text.secondary` | `#B8C29E` | Supporting information |
| `text.tertiary` | `#8C947A` | Nonessential metadata |
| `text.disabled` | `#FFFFFF`, alpha 0.40 | Disabled labels |
| `status.warning` | `#E3AD36` | Warning plus icon/explanation |
| `status.error` | `#E46D56` | Error plus icon/explanation |
| `status.success` | `#B5C784` | Confirmation plus icon/explanation |

Status colors are openQ4 semantic additions, not claims about exact retail
samples. Validate their composited contrast in all backgrounds. Team colors
and family overrides come from gameplay/source tokens; color is never the
only distinction between teams, enabled states or errors.

`surface.panel`, `surface.inset`, `text.secondary` and `text.tertiary` are
openQ4 tokens for cards and dense data that need a solid readable backing.
Stock Marine plates are black or olive-tinted white, and stock supporting text
is white at reduced alpha.

### Measured Marine tokens

| Token | sRGB hex / source value | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `marine.value` | `#FFBE23` / 1, 0.745, 0.137, alpha 0.80 | Setting values, slider ticks and thumb, key names, editable values |
| `marine.rail.dark` | `#CCCC51`, baked into dark plates | Rails of navigation plates and chat box |
| `marine.rail.card` | `#A0A040`, baked into card frames | Card and tooltip frame rail |
| `marine.rim` | `#626934`, alpha 0.37 falling linearly to 0 across 19 u, with a faint tail to 25 u | Rim light outside framing band edges |
| `marine.glow` | `#616F26` peak, applied at 70% | Additive backdrop light band |
| `marine.glow.modal` | `#46501B` peak | Additive glow field behind modals |
| `marine.list` | `#FF9C00` | List hover band 16% and selection band 41%, 50% in server lists; the row rule is white at 50% |
| `marine.list.alt` | `#9A9C6E`, alpha 0.29 | Server-browser hover band |
| `marine.check` | `#586A08` | Filled square of a set check or radio box |
| `marine.sort` | `#9BA545` | Sortable column hover highlight |
| `marine.plinth` | `#3E4A21`, alpha 0.30 | Plinth under the secondary links |
| `marine.progress` | `#E06C00`; track 30%, fill 50% | Loading and refresh progress |
| `marine.scrim` | `#000000`, alpha 0.94 | Front-end modal scrim |
| `text.title` | `#FFFFFF`, alpha 0.50 | Screen titles, secondary links |
| `text.heading` | `#FFFFFF`, alpha 0.40 | Section and column headings |

Olive-tinted light plates are white art multiplied by `marine.olive`; dark
plates are black art with `marine.rail.dark` rails. Both rest at 40%.

### Opacity

| Layer | Rest | Interaction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Action and navigation plate, light or dark | 0.40 | Hover or focus: 0.80 for primary navigation and action buttons, 1.00 for section navigation and value rows; 1.00 for the current page |
| Marker | 0.40 `marine.marker` | 1.00 `marine.orange`, with the label |
| Action label | 0.80 white | 1.00 `marine.orange`; about 3% larger |
| Screen title | 0.50 white | Stable |
| Section and column headings | 0.40 white | Stable |
| Secondary link | Label 0.50, marker 0.40, no plate | Label and marker orange |
| Separators | Olive 0.26 on pages and 0.32 in cards; white 0.10 in multiplayer tables and entry dialogs, up to 0.30 in the HUD statistics panel | Never compete with labels |
| Card frame | 0.94 black body inside its rail | Stable |
| Modal frame | 0.70 black silhouette over the glow field | Stable |
| Modal scrim | 0.94 black | Fades in over 200 ms, out over 250 ms |
| Framing bands | 1.00 in the front end; 0.40 in the in-game MP menu | Move; never fade |
| Table header band | 0.60 olive | Stable; no perpetual pulsing |

The stock marks a primary action by size, not opacity: START GAME is a
356x43 u light plate with a 24 dp label. openQ4's in-game join card rests its
primary action at 0.62, secondary actions at 0.28 and its header wash at 0.16
so the live scene stays readable; that variant is limited to in-game partial
panels.

Node opacity applies to the completed node and its descendants as one isolated
group. Overlapping controls, text, washes and rails must retain their internal
appearance throughout a fade. Nested opacity composes inside-out; paint alpha
remains intrinsic to each primitive. Crossing opacity 1 cannot reorder siblings.
Editor previews use the same composition and clipping rules as gameplay.

### Light and composition modes

Stock menus are lit, not only painted. Measured material blends:

- **Additive** (`blend add`): the backdrop light band, the modal glow field,
  the Quake 4 wordmark, loading-band light and corner brackets, credit bars,
  and terminal scanlines, glows and reflections.
- **Darkening** (`GL_ZERO, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_COLOR`): the Q emblem on the home
  screen multiplies the backdrop by the inverse of its color, so it reads as a
  shadow cast in the light band.
- **Straight alpha**: plates, rails, markers, text and everything else.
- **Masked additive** (HUD): a mask pass writes a shape into destination
  alpha, and the layer is then added only inside it. The EKG, the radio
  waveform and the Strogg gauge grain use it; the low-health rim and powerup
  emblems are plain additive.

The vector renderer provides additive and darkening composition per primitive
or layer on every backend. Group opacity scales a layer's contribution without
changing its blend equation. Do not bake light into opaque color: an additive
band must brighten the imagery beneath it. Opaque accessibility backing
replaces the light only behind the text it supports.

Shaped content clipping and reveals use editable vector alpha masks in the
owning node's border-box coordinates. Masks move and scale with that node;
fixed dp chamfers retain their proportions as the frame expands. Mask coverage
applies once to the completed subtree, including text and nested panels. Curved
holes and partially transparent reveals must preserve clean edges without color
fringes. Mask RGB never changes the content color or coverage. Nested masks
compose inside-out, and an explicitly empty mask exposes no content. The editor
must display and edit the same mask geometry used by runtime rendering.

Body text must remain readable over the brightest permitted scene. Target
4.5:1 composited contrast for essential normal text and 3:1 for large text and
essential control boundaries. If stock opacity fails, strengthen the local
plate or use the existing text-backing accessibility setting. Preserve the
original look where it meets the target. High-contrast mode uses opaque local
backing and independently strengthens rails, selection and focus. The stock
40% and 50% text roles (headings, titles, secondary links) are the likeliest
failures over the additive band; measure them first.

## 5. Typography and language

Use shipped scalable equivalents of Marine for headings/actions and Lowpixel
for supporting text where available. Preserve the Marine small-cap character.
Resolve fonts from installed assets; do not copy proprietary faces into Git.
Scalable fallback faces require a compatible licence and explicit attribution.

### Faces

| Face | Character | Stock use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Marine | Wide, extended geometric small capitals; lower case renders as small capitals | Titles, navigation, action labels, loading titles |
| Lowpixel | Bold neo-grotesque, mixed case | Row labels and values, lists, body, notices |
| Profont | Monospaced | Tabular server detail |
| Chain | Condensed square technical face; its retail space has zero advance | Marine HUD numerals |
| R_Strogg | Angular all-capital Latin | Strogg HUD numerals and Strogg terminals |
| Strogg | Alien runes mapped onto Latin | Strogg devices; credit and intro decode reveals |

Measured ink cap height per em: Marine 0.50, Lowpixel 0.75, Chain 0.63,
Profont 0.75, R_Strogg 0.67. Size tokens are ems; compare faces by cap height.

### Type ramp

| Role | Face | Size / line height (dp) | Stock `textscale` | Color |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Screen title | Marine | 18 / 22 | 0.25 | `text.title` |
| Primary navigation | Marine | 24 / 28 | 0.33 | `text.primary` |
| Section navigation | Marine | 22 / 26 | 0.31 | `text.primary` |
| Action button, modal title | Marine | 20 / 24 | 0.28 | `text.primary` |
| Action row | Marine | 19 / 23 | 0.26 | `text.primary` |
| Secondary link | Marine | 16 / 20 | 0.22 | `text.title` |
| Row label, value, modal body | Lowpixel | 17 / 21; wrapped 17 / 22 | 0.24 | `text.primary`; values `marine.value` |
| List row | Lowpixel | 16 / 20 in a 30 dp row | 0.22 | `text.primary` |
| Section heading | Lowpixel | 14 / 18, upper case | 0.20 | `text.heading` |
| Column heading, metadata | Lowpixel | 13 / 16 | 0.18 | `text.heading` |
| Tabular detail | Profont | 13 / 16 | 0.18 | `text.primary` |
| Loading level name, status | Marine | 26 / 30, 29 / 34 | 0.36, 0.40 | White 0.80, 1.00 |
| HUD readout | Chain (Marine), R_Strogg (Strogg) | Source-derived and recorded per group; Marine health and ammo 36 dp | 0.50 | Family readout color; stable digit alignment |

Screen titles read as paths, for example `SETTINGS - SYSTEM`. Stock line
spacing is a font cell of about 1.17 em; the ramp opens it slightly for larger
displays and long translations. 13 dp is the floor for essential text; stock
0.16 captions (11.5 dp) rise to it.

### Tracking, case and alignment

Use each face's own spacing by default; 94% of stock main-menu text does.
Modal titles and dense hover-card lines tighten by 1 u per glyph (about
-0.075 em for Marine titles, -0.1 em for small Lowpixel lines), and the
loading level name by 2 u (about -0.1 em). Express tracking in em; do not
import a fixed bitmap texel offset.

Navigation and action strings are upper case in the language tables; setting
labels and values use sentence case; section headings are upper-case Lowpixel.
Marine renders lower case as small capitals, so mixed-case translations stay
consistent.

Stock labels lead (99% of main-menu text). Numerals align to the trailing
edge of fixed boxes. Centered text is reserved for overlay notices, the HUD
weapon name, tab labels and cinematic credits. Never center an action label on
a plate. Text over gameplay or imagery takes the stock drop shadow: a black copy
1.5 dp toward the trailing bottom at the text's own alpha.

Baselines and cap height determine label/icon alignment. Rasterize glyphs for
their output size; snapping cannot destroy kerning. Scale animations use
sufficient atlas density for their largest size.

All display strings use the language system, including editor menus, tooltips,
validation and accessibility labels. Preserve `#str_*` keys, format arguments,
inline icons and color escapes. Support UTF-8 decoding, glyph fallback,
composition/IME and text selection. Integrate and test shaping/bidirectional
support before claiming languages that require them. Do not invent translations
or use silent English fallback as evidence of completed localization.

Test long existing translations and a 40% expansion fixture. Wrap text, grow
rows and prioritize labels over decoration. Truncate only nonessential list
metadata and expose its full value through detail/tooltip. Never truncate an
action verb, confirmation choice or essential error instruction.

## 6. Framing and vector geometry

Draw paths, polygons, strokes, gradients and masks through the engine vector
UI renderer. Static axis-aligned rails snap to physical pixel centers; moving
geometry remains continuous. Diagonals/curves need coverage antialiasing at all
scales. Stroke width uses dp with a one-physical-pixel lower bound for essential
rails. Tessellation error is measured after transforms in output pixels.

### Stock furniture vocabulary

Every element below is reconstructed as editable vector geometry from the
measured construction. Appendix B holds the texel measurements.

Plates and markers:

| Element (stock art) | Measured construction |
| --- | --- |
| Light plate (`b3_light`, `b4_light`, `b6_light`) | Visible band 25/32 of the rectangle height; lower-leading 45-degree cut through 56% of the band; one-texel rails on the leading edge, cut and bottom; fill 49%; fill and bottom rail full to 33–50% of the width, then linear to zero at the trailing end; white art tinted `marine.olive` |
| Dark plate (`b1_dark`, `b2_dark`, `b5_dark`) | Visible band 30/64 of the rectangle height; cut through 47% of the band; opaque black fill to 40–57% of the width, zero at 78–94%; rails in `marine.rail.dark` |
| Header band (`header`, `scoreheader`) | Upper-leading cut of 8 texels, drawn about 9 u on the browser header and 7 u on team headers; top and leading rails; fill 49%, full to half the width, half at 75% and 10% at 95%; olive at 0.60 in menus; on scoreboards the team colors, `#8B964B` for deathmatch and Tourney and `#999999` for spectators, all at 1.00 |
| Link plinth (`bg2`) | Solid band with a lower-leading cut and a trailing end cut at 45 degrees, parallel to it; `marine.plinth` |
| Marker (`corner`) | Right triangle filling the upper-trailing half of its square (◥), legs half the tile, halo about 20% of the tile beyond the solid; mirrored vertically (◢) as the sort marker |

Frames and bands:

| Element (stock art) | Measured construction |
| --- | --- |
| Card frame (`tooltip_edge`, `tooltip_mid`) | Black body at 0.94; 1 u `marine.rail.card` rail on every edge; 2 u top-leading cut and 8 u top-trailing cut; the bottom cap is the top cap rotated 180 degrees; the art sits 2 u inside its window, and a 128-texel variant keeps the 8 u cut on small cards |
| Modal frame (`popup_top`, `popup_mid`, `popup_btm`, `popup_bg`) | Black silhouette at 0.70 over an additive glow column; leading tooth, recessed title slot and raised trailing section along the top; deep lower-leading chamfer; square trailing corners; no rails. The glow column is exactly the dialog's width, uniform across it and graded only vertically (half at 28% and 72% of its height), reaching about 87 u above and 108 u below the standard frame, so a 6 dp lit margin and the lit slot outline the silhouette |
| Tab strip (`ctrls_tab*`, `admin_tab*`, `summ_tab*`) | Baseline rail, broken under the active tab; the active tab rises about 22 u with a small leading flare and a 12 u 45-degree trailing shoulder; fill `#5A652A` from 1.00 at the top to 0.60 at the baseline, then a wash across the whole strip fading to zero over one tab height; centered Marine labels; each texture bakes one active position, widths fitted to the labels |
| Chat box (`chatbox_edge`, `chatbox_mid`) | Rails in `marine.rail.dark` along the top, bottom and leading edges with small chamfers at both leading corners; the top and bottom rails dissolve toward the open trailing side (full to 40%, half at 65%); black fill 0.49; the whole box at 0.40 |
| Framing bands (`topbar`, `btmbar`) | Opaque black silhouettes (Appendix B.2) with `marine.rim` light |
| Loading edges (`load_top_edge`, `load_btm_edge`, `*_edgeadd`, `load_corner`) | Black 0.80 bands with one 45-degree riser each and additive olive light (full at the edge, half at 41 u, gone by 80 u); corner brackets in 52 u windows with about 24 u legs, a 0.8 u white core and a warm 7 u halo, additive at `#3A3A3A` |
| Separators (`horiz_line2`, `vert_line`, `vert_line2`) | A two-texel line, about 2 dp, centered in a 5–6 u strip; `vert_line` fades over its last 6% at each end, the others end square |

Fields, lists and backdrop:

| Element (stock art) | Measured construction |
| --- | --- |
| Slider (`slider_bg`, `slider_bar`) | Tick ramp: alternating tall and short ticks rising from 2 to 9 u across the 71 u range above a baseline; 4x8 u bar thumb with a bright border and 40% interior; `marine.value` |
| Check or radio box (`box`, `box_check`) | Square outline, stroke 1/16 of the box (18 dp box in stock); set state is an inset filled square 69% of the box in `marine.check` |
| Scrollbar (`scrollbarv`, `scrollbar_thumb`) | 16 u gutter with no arrow buttons (the stock loads arrow art but never draws it); a fixed 16 u thumb tile with top, bottom and trailing rails and an open leading side, tinted by the list's text color and white while hovered; a trough of one light line with a faint fill in the list's color. The server browser adds its own `arrow6` buttons on 22x16 u tiles above and below the gutter |
| List bands (`bg_hover`, `bg_focus`, `bg_line`, `*2`) | One band per row, in priority selected, greyed, hovered, then the resting line, drawn 3 u below the row top; hovered text turns white. Menu lists: `marine.list` at 16% hover and 41% selection with soft ends and a white 50% hairline under every row. Server and multiplayer lists (`*2`): no hairline; a faint `#9A9C6E` line band at 8%, hover `#9A9C6E` at 29%, selection `marine.list` at 50%, greyed `#787E87` at 41%, ends fading over 22% |
| Progress (`load_bar`, `load_bar3`) | Cylindrical shading with a bright center line; `load_bar` carries a lower-leading cut; `marine.progress` |
| Backdrop (`screen`, `bg_darkgrad*`, `bg_grid`, `static1`) | Additive light band peaking at half its height; vertical vignette from 97% black at top and bottom to clear at the middle; `+` grid of 20 u one-texel crosses; page backing clear across its leading 19%, full from about 35%, applied at 60% |

### Plate and button anatomy

Action plates are open shapes. Rails run along the leading edge, around the
lower-leading cut and along the bottom; there is no top or trailing rail, and
the fill and bottom rail dissolve toward the trailing end, so a plate never
reads as a closed box. Rails are 1.5 dp at the reference, never thinner than
one physical pixel.

| Measure | Navigation plate | Action button | Settings row |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Construction | Dark plate | Light plate | Light plate |
| Visible plate / target | 37 / 45 dp | 35 / 45 dp | 29 / 36 dp |
| Lower-leading cut | 17 dp (47%) | 20 dp (56%) | 16 dp (56%) |
| Marker | 9 dp | 8 dp | None on value rows; 9 dp on action rows |
| Label | Marine 24 or 22 dp after the marker | Marine 20 dp after the marker | Lowpixel 17 dp, 21 dp in; value column at 64% of the row; action rows Marine 19 dp after the marker |

Minimum width is 112 dp. The marker's legs sit inside the label's cap band,
its visible leading edge 12–14 dp after the plate's leading rail; the label
follows 4 dp after the marker, with at least 16 dp before the fade region. A
45-degree cut always has equal horizontal and vertical extent after layout.
Stock bitmaps skew it whenever a plate is stretched; reconstruct the 45 degrees.
Plate, marker and label form one semantic control and one target. Widen the
straight span without deforming the cut.

At rest the plate is 0.40, the marker olive 0.40 and the label white 0.80.
Hover raises the plate (section 4) and turns label and marker orange, and the
label grows about 3% (stock +0.01 `textscale`) through a local transform that
never reflows neighbors. The current page keeps the same treatment with its
plate at 1.00. Value rows brighten only their plate; their label and value
keep their colors. Focus adds a fine orange inset rail and solid marker,
which keeps keyboard focus distinct from the current page; the stock drew both
identically. Press briefly emphasizes the inner edge and moves contents 1 dp
inward; release restores current focus/hover state. Movement never changes
layout or the hit target.

### Panel anatomy

Choose the panel construction by purpose, not size.

**Card** (hover cards, tooltips, in-game partial panels such as the join card):
a black body at 0.94 inside a single `marine.rail.card` rail; 12 dp 45-degree
cuts at the top-trailing and bottom-leading corners and 3 dp cuts at the
top-leading and bottom-trailing corners. Small popovers keep this construction
with the same cuts. Content inset is 24 dp, 16 dp in compact mode and
10 dp on hover cards (stock 6–7 u). A panel header is 40 dp, with a 1 dp
rule below and an 8 dp triangle before its title; the header wash fades
toward the trailing edge. Body height follows content; scroll regions clip
inside the rail. Footer actions have 16 dp separation and align to the
action edge. Small cards keep the 12 dp major cut; only one-line hints shrink
it, to 10 dp.

**Modal** (front-end confirmations, entry, list and advanced-settings
dialogs): the `marine.scrim` covers the screen; an additive glow column peaking
in `marine.glow.modal`, exactly as wide as the dialog, stands behind it; the
dialog is a black 0.70 silhouette. Along its top edge a 6 dp leading tooth, a
title slot opening across about 73% of the width with 45-degree flanks down to
a floor about 66% wide, and a raised trailing section; a deep lower-leading
chamfer; square trailing corners; no rail lines, because the glow outlines the
silhouette. The title (Marine 20 dp, tracking -0.075 em) starts at the foot of
the slot's leading flank with its baseline on the raised sections' top line, so
its capitals stand in the lit slot above the empty floor. Body text is inset
33 dp. Actions sit 30 dp from the leading edge and 33 dp from the trailing edge,
about 16 dp above the bottom, the affirmative action leading. Stock dialogs come
in five widths, and the art stretches with them:

| Dialog | Width | Slot depth | Chamfer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Confirmation, entry and list (136 u tall at y 155) | 480 dp | 17 dp | 38 dp |
| System message, connection and death menu | 540 dp | 20 dp | 46 dp |
| Ban list | 548 dp | 22 dp | 50 dp |
| Advanced video, audio and server options | 612–642 dp | 25 dp | 56 dp |

Titles are upper case, a noun or a question (EXIT GAME, OVERWRITE SAVE?);
bodies are sentence case; actions are short verbs (YES and NO, CONNECT and
CANCEL, OK, CLOSE).

**Band**: the framing bands and loading edges below.

Card, with minor cuts at the top-leading and bottom-trailing corners and major
cuts at the other two (the outline is rotationally symmetric):

```text
  ______________________
 /                      \
|                        \
|                         \
|                          |
 \                         |
  \                        |
   \______________________/
```

Modal silhouette, with the title set in the recessed slot and no rails:

```text
 _   LOAD DEFAULTS      _______
| \____________________/       |
|                              |
|                              |
 \                             |
  \                            |
   \___________________________|
```

### Pop-up frames

Every transient surface uses one of these constructions. Stock rows restate
measured constructions; openQ4 rows reuse stock parts.

| Frame | Construction | Placement | Motion | Dismissal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Modal (stock) | Modal silhouette over the scrim and glow column | Centered horizontally, 17 u above center; one of the five stock widths; the body scrolls beyond 70% of the safe height | `modal.enter`, `modal.leave` | An explicit choice, or Back as the negative action; never an outside click |
| Card (stock) | Card | Anchored to its invoker, or docked as the detail area | `content.in`, `content.out` | Focus leaves the invoker, or Back |
| Hover card (stock) | Card with a 10 dp inset | 6 dp from the pointer, moving to its leading side near the trailing edge | Appears at once | The pointer leaves |
| Tooltip | Small popover | 12 dp after and 15 dp below the pointer | `tooltip` after 300 ms | The pointer leaves, or any input |
| Statistic and award cards (stock) | Card, 128 or 256 u wide | 6 dp below and after the pointer; in game, award cards move to its leading side | After 500 ms, fading to 0.94 over 250 ms | The pointer leaves |
| System message (stock) | Modal, 540 dp wide | Centered | None: it appears and closes at once | An explicit choice |
| Dropdown list | The stock kick-player list rebuilt in the popover construction: as wide as the value column, eight rows, then it scrolls | Unfolds downward from its value, or upward when the space below is short; never over its own row | `list.unfold`; a pick closes it at once | A selection, Back or an outside click, which goes no further |
| Action popover (openQ4) | Small popover with a glyph on every row | Anchored to the invoking prompt or row | `popover.enter`, `popover.leave` | A selection or Back |
| Notice (openQ4) | Header-band plate (section 13.14) | The top band's trailing section | `notice.enter`, `notice.leave` | Timeout or resolution |
| Countdown (openQ4) | Modal with a tick ramp | As the modal | As the modal | Keep, Revert or timeout |

**Placement.** A frame stays 16 dp inside the safe area. It flips to the other
side of its anchor before it clips, and it never covers the crosshair, the
prompt bar or the touch controls. A frame opened from the keyboard or a
controller anchors to the focused control; one opened by the pointer anchors
to the pointer.

**Layering.** From bottom to top: HUD, in-game partial panels, menu screens,
cards and popovers, modals, notices, and the pointer. One modal shows at a
time; a second request waits until the first closes.

**Focus.** A modal contains focus and returns it to its invoker. A popover
opened from the keyboard or a controller takes focus and returns it on close.
Hover cards and tooltips never take focus, and the detail area replaces them
for controller and touch players.

### Framing bands

The home and page states use the same two band paths in different positions
(Appendix B.2). The top band's inner edge runs straight, rises through three
9 u notches with 45-degree flanks (36 u across the top, 97 u pitch), and
steps up by 35 u at a 45-degree riser. The bottom band's inner edge rises
30 u, later drops 43 u, and carries two 9 u steps near its ends, all at
45 degrees. `marine.rim` light falls from 37% to zero across 19 u outside
every inner edge, measured by distance from the edge so flanks, risers and
steps glow as evenly as the flats. The light is part of the band's own art in
straight alpha, not an additive layer; only the loading-screen edges carry a
separate additive light.

Keep notches, risers and steps as named path segments so expansion lengthens
only the straight spans. On wide displays the flat spans extend to the
viewport edges while notches, risers and steps keep their stock positions
relative to the 4:3 content region. A generic beveled rectangle is not a
substitute for these silhouettes. The stock art already reaches 400 u beyond
the canvas's leading edge; openQ4's bitmap menus repeat edge tiles, which the
vector bands replace.

### HUD and diegetic geometry

The 45-degree motif belongs to the Marine menus. Other families keep their
own measured geometry:

- **Marine HUD gauges** (125x59 u): a backing body at black 0.50, 123x40 u
  with 1–1.4 u corner radii, and a foot 6.9 u deep under its trailing end, 32%
  of the body wide at the top and 25% at the bottom, reached by a 45-degree
  flank. The fill plate is inset 4.4 u at the sides and 4.6 u at top and bottom
  and bevelled in its own tint (58% brightness inside, 97% at every edge over
  about 7 u). Its lower-trailing corner is notched: a ledge at a third of the
  fill height runs 14.2 u in from the trailing edge, then a concave arc of
  radius 16.6 u meets the bottom edge 26 u from the trailing edge. The item icon
  sits in the notch over the foot. The armor fill is 19% brighter and divided
  into ten cells by nine soft dividers, 1.5 u wide at 61% alpha on an 11.7 u
  pitch. The health gauge masks the EKG. Plates and numerals are sheared by
  0.22, about 12 degrees, so their tops lean toward the trailing edge.
- **Strogg HUD gauges** (129x67 u): a raised tab at the top-leading area and a
  30-degree leading shoulder, no foot; the fill steps down its leading edge in
  30–33-degree diagonals and is cut away below its lower-trailing third. They are
  sheared the opposite way, with unsheared R_Strogg numerals and a masked grain
  layer over each gauge.
- **Weapon-select strip**: 24.4 u rounded plates on a 30 u pitch, centered, each
  sheared about its own center, with upright 18 u icons and the weapon name
  centered below (section 14.5).
- **World terminals**: a layered CRT surface of content, additive scanlines
  drifting 0.2 texture heights per second, dirt and scratches, static, a bezel
  vignette with a thin bright edge, and an additive glass reflection.

Shear and rotation pivot on each element's own rectangle center in virtual
space. An element's transform replaces its container's instead of composing
with it, and clipping applies to the unsheared rectangle first. A sheared gauge
therefore stays in place: its top edge moves 6.5 u toward the trailing side and
its bottom edge 6.5 u toward the leading side. Reproduce the drawn geometry and
verify it against captures instead of re-deriving it from authored rectangles.

### Icons and paths

Author simple symbols as editable paths: triangle, chevrons, close, back,
settings gear, checkbox/tick, radio, lock, favorite, dedicated server,
spectator, repeater, sorting, warning/error, keyboard/controller prompts and
the original HUD's simple instrument symbols. Use an optical 24x24 dp master
with 16/20/32 dp placements; 1.5 dp nominal stroke with deliberate caps/joins.
Use filled silhouettes where strokes cannot preserve the original symbol.

Each icon has a semantic name, bounds, anchor, source-reference description and
state variations. Do not replace game symbols with font glyphs or emoji.
Vector source stays editable; compiled geometry is derived. Preserve holes,
cutouts, gradients and important asymmetry. The editor exposes path nodes,
handles, joins, stroke alignment, fills and gradient stops.

| Symbol (stock art) | Stock form | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Marker (`corner`) | ◥ with halo | Action and section marker; ◢ sort direction |
| Arrow (`common/arrow6`) | Filled downward triangle | Spinner arrows when rotated 90 degrees on dark squares |
| Chevrons (`common/arrow1`, `arrow5`) | Thick single chevron; double-stroke outline chevron | Back and next; expand |
| Go (`icon_arrow`) | Shaft and head with bevel shading | Leave, exit, go |
| Create (`createserver_arrow`) | Arrow entering a bracket | Create server, launch |
| Gear (`common/gear1`, `gear1_still`) | Toothed ring | Settings; the animated variant turns once per 10 s |
| Favorite (`icon_favorite`) | Gold star with a red rim glow | Server list |
| Locked (`icon_locked`) | Shaded padlock | Password required |
| Dedicated (`icon_dedserver`) | Server case with a green power light | Dedicated server |
| Repeater (`icon_repeater`) | Television with antennas and color bars | Q4TV repeater |
| PunkBuster (`icon_pb`) | Service mark | Discontinued service; no replacement column required |
| Faction marks (`marinelogo`, `strogglogo`) | Hexagonal spearhead; winged lightning emblem | Teams |
| Quake emblem (`q4logo`) | Flat Q emblem | Home-screen watermark (darkening) |
| Pointer (`guicursor_arrow`, `guicursor_hand`) | Shaded arrow; hand | Pointer states |
| HUD and items (`gfx/guis/hud/icons`) | Flat glyphs; weapon renders are shaded gray side views and powerups are colored emblems drawn additively | Health, armor, ammo, weapons, powerups, flags; `simpleicons` are world pickup sprites, not HUD art |

Server-list symbols sit on a small gray tile with a cut upper-leading corner;
the tile is part of the symbol. Multi-color symbols keep their colors. The
weapon and item color code (Appendix B.4) is gameplay information.

### Bitmap exceptions

Only complex pictorial content uses bitmaps/video: levelshots, scene backdrops,
portraits, photographic/painted imagery, cinematics and detailed illustrations
whose character depends on textured content. Resolve installed assets and
sample at appropriate quality. Logos/diagrams require individual classification;
complexity, not convenience, justifies an exception. Simple logo outlines,
frames, reticles and checkboxes require vector work.

| Stock content | Classification |
| --- | --- |
| Levelshots, backdrop images, save previews, objective shots | Bitmap exception |
| MP award medals; publisher logos (id, Raven, Activision, Miles) | Bitmap exception |
| Multiplayer symbols: flags, stopwatch, infinity, ready, speaker, friend, skull, swirl, Quake emblem | Vector |
| Weapon renders (`gun_*`) and powerup emblems | Bitmap exception: shaded or colored pictorial art |
| Quake 4 wordmark (`q4text`) | Classify individually: textured glowing letterforms; its glow may become vector light |
| Quake emblem, faction marks, simple HUD silhouettes | Vector |
| CRT dirt, scratches, glass reflections | Bitmap exception |
| Static grain | Procedural noise; a bitmap only where the look depends on the stock grain |
| Light bands, vignettes, page backing, list bands, progress shading | Vector gradients |
| Scanlines, reticle grid, tick ramps, EKG and waveform traces | Vector or procedural patterns |
| Frames, plates, markers, boxes, arrows, scrollbars, tabs | Vector |

Record each exception with purpose and source in the migration inventory.
Generated glyph coverage atlases are a text-rendering detail, not permission
to reuse low-resolution bitmap type. Native paths must not become a fixed-size
atlas. If an SVG feature is unsupported, diagnose it; do not silently rasterize
furniture to hide the limitation.

### Detailing

Detail decides whether a reconstruction reads as authored or traced. These
rules apply to every family and every size class.

- **Rails and joins.** A rail is one continuous stroke through every cut,
  mitered at 45 degrees, with no gap and no brightening where segments meet.
  Rails are 1.5 dp and never thinner than one physical pixel; static
  axis-aligned rails snap to pixel centers.
- **Cuts.** Use the measured cut ladder: 2 and 3 dp minor cuts, 10 dp on
  one-line hints, 12 dp card cuts, about 14 dp on header bands, 17 and 20 dp
  plate cuts, and the modal chamfer, 38 dp on the standard dialog and up to
  56 dp on the widest. A cut keeps equal horizontal and vertical extent at
  every size and never falls below 3 dp on an essential control.
- **Fades.** Fill and rail fades are linear in straight alpha across the stated
  span. On 8-bit targets, dither any fade wider than 128 physical pixels so it
  never bands.
- **Markers.** A marker sits inside its label's cap band; its halo reaches 20%
  of the tile beyond the solid and never touches a rail.
- **Separators.** A two-texel line, about 2 dp, centered in a 5–6 u strip:
  olive at 0.26 on pages and 0.32 in cards, white at 0.10 in multiplayer tables.
  In a card a rule starts 8 dp inside the leading rail and stops about 25 dp
  short of the trailing rail, and a divider stops 6 dp short of the rule and the
  bottom rail. A separator never touches a rail.
- **Locked and unavailable.** Unavailable content rests at 0.40 and states its
  reason in the detail area. Locked content adds the lock symbol and a
  45-degree hatch of 1 dp lines on an 8 dp pitch at 0.10 over its plate. Hatch
  never marks an enabled control.
- **Numbers and units.** Use tabular figures wherever digits change or align.
  A space separates a value from its unit (`144 Hz`, `16 ms`, `1.2 GB`), except
  for percentages and multipliers (`125%`, `4x`). Resolutions use the
  multiplication sign with spaces (`2560 × 1440`), ranges an en dash
  (`75–200%`) and durations `m:ss`. Decimal and grouping separators follow the
  language.
- **Text fitting.** Labels wrap before they shrink. Metadata may truncate with
  an ellipsis when the detail area shows the full value; an action never
  truncates.
- **Light.** Glows are additive, capped at the family's light peak, and never
  stack where controls overlap; focus light and rim light share one light
  layer per surface.
- **Texture.** Grain, scanlines and the reticle grid are screen-space layers
  below text. They never move with content, and depth shift (section 13.8)
  moves them only as whole layers. The reticle grid, grain and light band
  belong to menu backdrops: the HUD, in-game overlays and world displays never
  draw them, and neither do previews of those surfaces.
- **Text shadow.** Text over gameplay or imagery carries the stock drop shadow
  (section 5); text on plates and cards never does.
- **Headings over lists.** A light plate flipped vertically, its cut at the
  upper-leading corner and its rail along the top, heads a list or a group.

| Detail | Construction | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dot matrix | Ten by two squares of 4 u on a 9 u pitch, `#1C2613` | Loading screens, top-leading corner |
| Corner brackets | L legs of about 24 u with a white core and a warm halo, additive | Loading picture corners |
| Credit bars | Additive `#FF8000` ramps brightening toward the name | Credits and game over |
| Level meter | Amber track at 0.40 and a full-strength bar squeezed to the level | Microphone level |
| Soft backing | A black slab with feathered sides and rounded corners at 0.60–0.90 | Scoreboard, summary, statistics |
| Name strip | A black gradient under a trailing-aligned title | Loading level name |
| Swatch | A small square with a chipped corner | Color choices, spinner tiles |
| Picture frame | A 1 u `#414624` border over black 0.60 | Save, server and map previews |

## 7. Components and interaction states

Controls declare default, hover, keyboard/gamepad focus, pressed, selected/
checked, disabled, busy and error states where applicable. Precedence is
disabled > error/busy constraints > pressed > focus > hover > selected >
default. Selection remains visible under focus; errors remain visible while
editing. Hidden controls receive no input.

Accept activates on a matched release. Multiple physical inputs mapped to one
action hold one logical press; releasing one source cannot activate while
another remains held. Navigation moves immediately, repeats after 320 ms, then
every 110 ms, independently of OS key repeat. Accept and Back do not repeat.
Focus loss, device removal, replacement and modal changes cancel pending activation. Controls
held across a menu/gameplay handoff must be released (or an axis returned to
neutral) before the next owner acts on them. A stall must not replay a burst of
navigation steps.

| Component | Visual and behavior contract |
| --- | --- |
| Action | Cut plate, marker, clear verb; one activation per action; disabled reason where useful |
| Checkbox | Square outline and inset filled square (the stock mark); shared label/box target; mixed state is an inset bar |
| Radio | The same square box; a set option fills its box; one selected, directional group navigation |
| Slider | Tick-ramp track, bar thumb, numeric value in `marine.value`; openQ4 drops ticks past the thumb to 40% to show the filled span; keyboard increments and precise entry |
| Choice/dropdown | Value in the value column that cycles in place; openQ4 dropdowns add a chevron and unfold, like the stock kick-player list, into a constrained scrollable popup; selected value visible |
| Text/numeric field | Recessed plate, caret/selection/composition; errors preserve edit and explain correction |
| Key binding | Keycap/controller glyph; distinct capture state; cancel and explicit conflict resolution |
| Tabs | Shared rail, active notch/marker; inactive pages receive no input; focus differs from selection |
| List/table | Stable headers, growing rows, sort indicator, selected rail, designed empty/loading/error states |
| Scrollbar | Narrow trough, cut usable thumb; paging, wheel and touch; no overlap with ornaments |
| Gauge/progress | Source-derived segments/path; truthful values; bounded quiet indeterminate sweep |
| Tooltip | Compact cut plate; 300 ms delay, immediate replacement within a group; avoid cursor/content |
| Modal | Strong title/body/action hierarchy; contained focus, restoration and no click-through |
| Status/toast | Contextual placement; no aim/critical-HUD obstruction; unresolved errors persist |
| Tree | Disclosure markers, selection and guides; preserve expansion/focus while updating |
| Path/color editor | Direct manipulation plus precise numbers; undoable edits and textual properties |

Server tables retain sorting, filtering, favorites, compatibility and selection
during refresh. Chat retains history, channels, caret movement and scroll
ownership; new messages cannot steal inspection position. Scoreboards identify
teams/spectators/local player with text or geometry as well as color; the stock marked the local player by brightness alone. Empty,
offline, disconnected and failed states cannot be unstyled debug output.
Section 13 defines each component's controller and touch behavior, the
prompt bar and the detail area.

### Stock control conventions

| Control | Stock construction |
| --- | --- |
| Setting row | Light plate; Lowpixel label 21 dp in; value in `marine.value` at 64% of the row |
| Boolean or enumeration | A value that cycles on activation and steps back on the secondary action; no arrows, no checkbox |
| Filter spinner | Value between ◀ and ▶ arrows (`arrow6`, orange 0.80) on 22x16 u black 0.40 tiles; hover turns an arrow `marine.value` at once, leaving returns it over 300 ms, and a press flashes white fading to yellow over 300 ms |
| Exclusive pair (Internet/LAN, Player/Clan) | Square boxes; the set option fills its box |
| Slider | Tick ramp at the value column, numeric value after it at 85% of the row |
| Text field | Entry fields in dialogs sit on a light plate without an outline, Lowpixel white 0.80 (`marine.value` for passwords); the save name and the in-game chat line use dark plates |
| Key binding | Key names in `marine.value` in the value column |
| List | Lowpixel column headings at 40% (30% on the controls page) with their baseline 7 u above an olive rule; 30 dp rows with `marine.list` bands and a rule under every row; multiplayer tables adapt their pitch to the entries (section 14.14), use drop-shadowed text and server-list bands, and have no hover band on the scoreboard |
| Dropdown | The only stock dropdown, the kick-player list, unfolds under the value column over 150 ms: a black body with a 1 u `#B2CD43` border at 20%, 14 u rows and server-list bands; a pick closes it at once |
| Disabled | Action plates and markers gray at 0.40 with labels at 0.40–0.50; value rows at 0.40; entries a server forbids at 0.20 |
| Server list | Olive 0.60 header band holding 28 dp column symbols; 27 dp rows; sortable columns highlight in `marine.sort`; flipped marker beside the sort notice; progress bar under the list |
| Hover card | Card frame at 0.94 that appears at once and follows the pointer 6 dp away; once the pointer passes 555 dp from the canvas's leading edge the card moves to its leading side, its trailing edge 28 dp past the pointer; Lowpixel 14 dp and Profont 13 dp content |
| Tooltip | Stock sort hints sit 12 dp right of and 15 dp below the pointer, appear after 1000 ms and fade in over 250 ms; multiplayer statistic and award cards appear after 500 ms and fade to 0.94 over 250 ms; the replacement shortens the delay (table above) |

Stock hit targets were invisible windows separate from the art. The replacement
makes each control one target spanning its full pitch. The stock drew the
current page's navigation plate exactly like hover; keep that for selection and
add the focus rail for keyboard and gamepad focus.

## 8. Motion, transitions and sound

Use a continuous monotonic presentation clock sampled each rendered frame.
Motion continues while gameplay is paused and cannot inherit simulation tick
rate. Game-state events retain authoritative time. Keys specify time, property,
value and easing; interpolate continuously at 144/240 Hz as well as 60 Hz.

Stock transitions take optional acceleration and deceleration arguments as
fractions of the duration, and the engine rescales them in proportion when they
sum past it. Every stock use does, so no stock transition has a constant-speed
phase. `accel(a, d)` below means constant acceleration for `a` ms, then constant
deceleration for `d` ms, with `a + d` the duration: stock `"500" "150" "150"`
is `accel(250, 250)` and peaks at twice the mean speed, and `"300" "100"
"150"` is `accel(120, 180)`. Unmarked stock transitions are linear. The stock
sampled motion at most once per 16 ms game frame; openQ4 samples every
presented frame.

| Motion token | Timing | Curve / use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hover.enter` | 0 ms | Plate, label and marker respond at once (stock) |
| `hover.leave` | 300 ms | Linear return (stock) |
| `press` | 60 ms | Fast ease-out, 1 dp inset movement (openQ4) |
| `focus` | 80 ms | Ease-out rail/marker; never delay navigation (openQ4) |
| `frame.dock` | 500 ms | `accel(250, 250)`; framing bands move between home and page positions, 50 ms after activation toward a page and at once on Back (stock) |
| `screen.depart` | 500 ms | `accel(250, 250)`; the home layer sweeps 640 u toward the trailing edge from 50 ms (stock) |
| `screen.return` | 300 ms | Linear; a page sweeps 640 u toward the leading edge on Back, carrying its plates (stock) |
| `content.out` | 250 ms | Linear fade of departing home plates, labels, markers and message of the day; secondary links and the plinth take 50 ms; a departing page drops its title at once, its Back action over 100 ms and its backing over 250 ms (stock) |
| `content.in` | 150 ms | Linear fade of the arriving title, backing, Back action and home content; a page's own plates appear at rest at once (stock) |
| `menu.fade` | 250 ms | Linear fade from black as the menu opens, and to black as the in-game menu closes (stock) |
| `band.slide` | 150 ms | Linear; in-game multiplayer and buy menu bands slide in from off-canvas, and out after a 50 ms hold (stock) |
| `row.flash` | 250 ms | Linear; row plates settle from 0.60 to rest when a Controls tab changes (stock) |
| `page.enter` | 220 ms | Cubic (0.16, 1, 0.3, 1); 12 dp slide and opacity, between sibling pages of one screen (openQ4) |
| `page.leave` | 140 ms | Cubic (0.4, 0, 1, 1); 8 dp departure and opacity (openQ4) |
| `modal.enter` | 200 ms | Scrim to 0.94, glow field brightens from black, frame to 0.70; title, body and actions appear together at 200 ms, because their stock fades ran while hidden; no scale (stock) |
| `modal.leave` | 50 + 250 ms | Contents hide at once; after 50 ms the scrim and glow fade over 250 ms and the frame over 200 ms (Exit, Load Defaults, Delete, Disconnect and Overwrite) or 250 ms (other dialogs) (stock) |
| `light.up` | 150 ms in, 250 ms out | Logos and glow fields fade from and to black rather than transparency (stock) |
| `row.reveal` | 120 ms | Opacity, optional 15 ms stagger capped at 90 ms total (openQ4) |
| `value.change` | 100 ms | Local emphasis; no perpetual blinking |
| `tooltip` | 100 ms | Opacity after initial delay |
| `popover.enter` | 100 ms | Linear opacity and 4 dp away from the invoker (openQ4) |
| `popover.leave` | 80 ms | Linear opacity (openQ4) |
| `list.unfold` | 150 ms | Linear height from its row downward; a pick closes it at once (stock) |
| `notice.enter` | 160 ms | Cubic (0.16, 1, 0.3, 1); 12 dp in from the trailing edge with opacity (openQ4) |
| `notice.leave` | 200 ms | Linear opacity; the stack closes up with `page.enter` easing (openQ4) |
| `wheel.open` | 90 ms | Opacity and scale from 0.96 about the wheel center (openQ4) |
| `wheel.close` | 70 ms | Linear opacity (openQ4) |
| `title.carry` | 500 ms | With `frame.dock`: the activated label travels into the title slot and scales to the title size (openQ4) |

These are authored defaults. Story-driven timing, terminal sequences, weapon
reticles and scripted effects remain faithful to sources. Marine menu screen
changes follow the stock choreography below; other major transitions may
choreograph frame/content groups, normally totaling less than 300 ms. Stock
hover growth (+0.01 `textscale`, about 3%) uses a local transform without
reflowing the button or moving neighbors.

### Stock choreography

**Home to page.** Activation plays `main_menu_selection` once. At 0 ms the
home content fades out (`content.out`) and the wordmark and emblem fade to
black (`light.up`). At 50 ms the whole home layer sweeps 640 u toward the
trailing edge (`screen.depart`) while the top band moves 323 u toward the
trailing edge and 63 u up and the bottom band 373 u toward the trailing edge
and 35 u down (`frame.dock`). At 550 ms the page appears in place: its own
navigation plates show at once at rest, and its title (to 0.50), backing and
Back action fade in (`content.in`). Every destination docks the bands at the
same position on the same timing. Destinations differ only in their backing:
0.60 for most pages, 0.80 for Friends, 0.90 for the server browser, opaque for
Credits and none for the Multiplayer hub. Save, the server browser and Friends
also raise a second, lower additive light band to 0.40.

**Back.** The page title disappears at once, the Back action fades over 100 ms
and the backing over 250 ms, and the page sweeps toward the leading edge with
its plates (`screen.return`). The bands start home at once (`frame.dock`),
without the 50 ms hold. At 500 ms the home content, already back in place,
fades in (`content.in`) and the wordmark and emblem light up from black.

**Within a screen.** The bands stay docked. Going deeper from the Multiplayer
hub fades the hub's plates over 150 ms while the hub sweeps 640 u toward the
trailing edge over 300 ms; returning sweeps the sub-page toward the leading
edge. The arriving page appears at 500 ms and fades in its title, backing and
Back action over 150 ms. Back always climbs one level. Settings categories
switched instantly in stock, without a fade; the 150 ms title fade happens only
on entry from home. Controls tabs switched instantly and flashed their row
plates (`row.flash`). `page.enter` and `page.leave` now cover sibling pages.

**Opening, closing and modals.** The menu opens under `menu.fade` from black
with the bands already at home; the in-game menu closes with `menu.fade` to
black, and single-player RETURN TO GAME closes at once. Modals never move the
bands. The Mods and Exit modals also dim the wordmark to 40% gray over 200 ms
and restore it over 150 ms.

**In-game multiplayer and buy menus.** There is no home state. The bands, at
0.40, slide in from fully off-canvas (`band.slide`) together with a 0.80 black
scrim over the match, the vignette, the light band, a 0.80 backing and the
grid, and slide out after a 50 ms hold. Pages switch by sweeping the outgoing
page toward the trailing edge over 150 ms and showing the next at 200 ms, with
no band motion.

The stock locked input for the whole choreography: 700 ms from home to a page
and back, 650 ms within the Multiplayer screen, 200 ms for a modal to open and
300 ms for it to close. The replacement stays responsive: input during a
transition retargets it instead of being dropped, and a control that is not
yet, or no longer, presented never activates. Reduced motion places bands and
pages at their destinations and cross-fades content within 80 ms.

### Band motion

The framing bands are the menu's largest moving surfaces; these rules keep
their motion legible at every size and refresh rate.

- **One path, two states.** Each band has exactly two dock states per menu,
  home and page (Appendix B.2), and moves along the straight line between
  them. Notches, risers and steps travel with the band and never deform;
  aspect expansion lengthens only the flat spans, which stay attached to the
  viewport edges throughout the move.
- **Profile.** `frame.dock` is `accel(250, 250)` for both bands, sampled every
  presented frame. The Classic layout keeps the stock start times; Remastered
  keeps the same curve and durations.
- **Retargeting.** Input that reverses a screen change starts the opposite
  move from the bands' current positions. The new move keeps the `accel`
  profile and takes a duration proportional to the remaining distance, at least
  150 ms and at most 500 ms, so position never jumps.
- **Title carry.** In Remastered, the activated navigation label travels into
  the title slot during `frame.dock` (`title.carry`) and becomes the path title
  (section 13.8).
- **Light.** The rim light is part of the band and moves with it; nothing
  pulses or flares on arrival.
- **Compact classes.** Dock states follow the band depth limits of section
  13.3. The page state keeps its measured notch and step geometry; only the
  travel distance shrinks.
- **Rate.** A screen change renders at the display rate. The Phone profile's
  30 Hz cap applies to a menu at rest, never to a change in progress.
- **Sound.** `main_menu_selection` plays once at activation; nothing plays
  during motion.

**Decode reveal** (credits and intros): the rune line fades in over 500 ms;
the Latin line then wipes open from the center over 1000 ms while settling
from white to its color, and the rune line fades out over the same 1000 ms.

### Ambient loops and alarms

| Stock loop | Measured | Treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backdrop levelshots | Cross-fade over 2000 ms every 5000 ms, four images | Decorative |
| Static grain | Scrolls 1 texture width and 5 texture heights per second at 2.4% | Decorative |
| Animated gear | One turn per 10 s | Decorative |
| Terminal scanlines | Drift 0.2 texture heights per second | Decorative |
| EKG trace | Two beats per width at 0.2 widths per second, 24 beats a minute (section 14.3) | Instrument; its information stays under reduced motion |
| Idle display flicker | 92–100% at 3 Hz; the 9 Hz overlay flicker of the machinegun and shotgun displays is capped at 3 Hz | Decorative |
| Warning shimmer (low ammo) | 80–100% at 3 Hz | Alarm |
| Alarm pulse (empty weapon display, low-health rim, boss shield) | 100–50% at 2 Hz | Alarm |
| Missile warning | 70–30% at 2.5 Hz | Alarm |
| Settings notice | 100–50% at 1 Hz | Alarm |
| Loading status | 100% to 50% over 500 ms, back over 200 ms | Decorative |
| Weapon display states | Hyperblaster random flicker 68–100%, low pulse at 3 Hz and RELOAD at 2 Hz; nailgun empty 100–40% at 2 Hz; rocket cells 80–100% at 3 Hz; railgun flicker 92–100% | Decorative; alarms where they mark low or empty |
| Vehicle warnings | Hull and shield 60% × 100–50% at 2 Hz; electric damage a 1 Hz sawtooth 70–30%; hits an additive edge flash over 500 ms | Alarm |

Alarms keep their stock cadence, all at or below 3 Hz, and always pair with a
static cue. Reduced motion stops decorative loops and replaces alarm pulses
with a steady emphasized state. No loop runs on essential text.

Retarget interrupted animations from current sampled values. Reversal cannot
jump to an endpoint. Different properties can animate concurrently; the most
recent explicit owner wins per property. Define activation, cancellation,
completion and teardown semantics. Modal input ownership starts before its
first visible frame. Handle rapid back/forward, repeated clicks, resizing,
theme changes and map shutdown.

Stock menus play `main_menu_mouseover` on each hover entry of an enabled
control and `main_menu_selection` on each activation, including value cycling,
sorting and closing a modal. Nothing plays on hover exit or during animation.
World terminals play `guisound_beep2` on actions, objective notices
`guisounds_click` once, scopes `snd_zoomin` and `snd_zoomout`, and the loading screen `load_screen_ready` and
`load_screen_click`; modals have no sound of their own. The front end plays
`main_menu` music and the in-game menu `main_menu_gameplay`. Use these through
existing sound declarations where appropriate. Play once per semantic event.
Gamepad focus gets equivalent feedback without duplicate hover sounds. Never
sound each animation frame or server-list refresh.

Reduced motion removes translation, scale, stagger, shake and decorative loops;
use immediate state changes or opacity fades up to 80 ms. Preserve essential
progress/gameplay information. Motion speed never determines whether a command
executes or a saved state restores correctly.

## 9. Screen composition and gameplay ownership

Main menu preserves complex level/scene imagery and recognizable rails.
Navigation occupies a stable leading region; the page uses remaining safe
width. Title/context/back affordances stay predictable. Settings align labels
and values, group related options, explain consequences, retain Apply/Revert
where needed and offer a recoverable video-mode confirmation countdown.

Pause retains the world and correct semantics: SP may pause; MP must not pretend
to pause the server. Partial in-game panels use established scene softening
rather than an indiscriminate full-screen dimmer. Front-end confirmation
modals keep the stock `marine.scrim`. Effect ownership survives stacked panels
and releases on every exit/shutdown. Offer opaque local backing as an
accessibility alternative.

Save/load shows slot title, timestamp and complex preview, with overwrite/delete
confirmation. Preserve selection through refresh and show failures in context.
Demo browser/player retains playback and camera controls. Arena, buy and Match
Control retain progression, authority, teams, queues and spectator behavior.

HUD values update without rebuilding the document; digits do not jitter and
decorative motion cannot obscure aim. Separate source alarm/damage events from
application transitions. Vehicle/scope views retain aim geometry and clipping.
Aspect expansion cannot distort cinematic bars or subtitle placement.

World GUIs preserve per-entity instances, named events, input-ray mapping,
trigger commands, save/restore and visibility. Port instrument/game widgets as
functional components. Screenshots or decorative approximations do not count.
Inspect ordinary and story-critical terminal flows in gameplay.

### Stock screen reference

Positions are source units on the 4:3 canvas. Expansion follows section 3.

**Main menu, home state.** The top band's inner edge runs at 104 u, rises to
95 u across three notches (41–77, 138–173 and 234–268 u) and steps up to
68.5 u through a riser between 315 and 352 u. The bottom band's inner edge
runs at 400 u from the leading edge to 345 u, drops to 444 u by 390 u and
rises to 435 u between 583 and 592 u. The wordmark (additive) sits at 6,119 u
(376x92 u) and the emblem watermark (darkening) at 380,125 u (260x260 u) on
the trailing side. Navigation plates bleed off the leading edge on a 30 u
pitch from 202 u, marker at 32 u, label at 44 u. In game, SAVE GAME and QUIT
CURRENT GAME replace NEW GAME and MULTIPLAYER, and RETURN TO GAME adds a fifth
plate. The message of the day sits at 44,364 u. Secondary links (MODS,
UPDATES, CREDITS, EXIT; EXIT alone in game) stand on the plinth at
401–426 u.

**Page state.** The top band moves 323 u toward the trailing edge and 63 u up;
the bottom band moves 373 u toward the trailing edge and 35 u down. The top
band then carries the screen title at 39,19 u and its notches over the
content column; the bottom band's raised trailing section holds Back at
532,441 u (109x30 u).

**Settings.** Section navigation plates run from 14 u across 208 u on a 30 u
pitch from 172 u. The content column starts at 228 u: section headings at
259 u, 14 u above their first row; rows on a 24 u pitch; labels at row +31 u;
values at row +240 u; slider ramps at row +244 u with the numeric value at row
+322 u; action rows with markers follow the rows of their group. The page
backing darkens the content column fully and fades across the navigation
column. openQ4 adds a scrollbar at the content column's trailing edge.

**New game.** Difficulty choices use section navigation plates beside a
description paragraph; START GAME is the enlarged primary plate.

**Save and load.** A 183x137 u preview with a 1 u olive border (`#414624`)
and its date and time below it on the leading side; the list on the trailing
side under Lowpixel column headings and an olive rule; Load and Delete as
section navigation plates.

**Server browser.** Header band (587x37 u) with column symbols, 18 u rows
across 604 u, a sort notice with the flipped marker and a CLEAR SORTING
action under the list, then a full-width refresh progress bar.

**Modal.** 320 u wide and 136 u tall at y 155, centered horizontally and 17 u
above center; body text at +22 u; actions of 120x30 u, 20 u from the leading
end and 22 u from the trailing end. Entry, list and settings dialogs grow to
146–400 u tall, and the system message box offers leading, center and trailing
actions.

**Loading.** Full-bleed levelshot; top band thick on the leading side with its
riser near the middle, bottom band thick on the trailing side; the level name
trails at the top (Marine 26 dp, tracking -0.1 em) over a gradient that fades
toward the leading side; progress bar from 235 to 640 u at 431 u with
`LOADING` trailing-aligned across it; corner brackets at the four corners of
the picture; the `+` grid over everything. A ten-by-two dot matrix marks the
top-leading corner. LOADING pulses from 100% to 50% over 500 ms and back over
200 ms with a drop shadow, then reads "- CLICK TO CONTINUE -". The
multiplayer loading screen raises the bottom band to 227 u, moves the progress
bar to 313 u and the lower brackets to 256 u, and adds the server name and
address, game type and limits, a message line over a 50% gradient and a row of
24 u item icons.

**Cinematic.** Black bars of 60 u top and bottom frame a 16:9 picture on the
4:3 canvas. Preserve that picture aspect rather than the bar height.

**Marine HUD.** Ammo (13 u), health (190 u) and armor (326 u) gauges, each
125x59 u at 420 u, with trailing-aligned numerals and 16 u icons in each gauge's
notch below them; the weapon render and reserve count on the ammo gauge; the
weapon-select strip at 370 u with the weapon name centered below at 392 u.
Section 14 records the rest of the HUD.

**In-game multiplayer menu.** The Marine menu vocabulary with framing bands at
0.40 docked 2 u lower and to the trailing side of the front-end page state,
over a 0.80 black scrim, the vignette and a 0.80 backing. It has no home state
(section 8); the buy menu uses the same construction.

## 10. Visual editor

The editor is a first-class desktop tool using the game's document evaluator,
vector renderer, fonts, components, layout and timeline code. Matching preview
is an invariant, including clipping/alpha. It creates, edits, saves, reopens and
packages complete interfaces without proprietary Flash authoring software.

### Workspace

Resizable/dockable hierarchy, canvas, inspector, asset/component browser,
timeline, diagnostics and event/state panels. Multiple documents, undo/redo,
dirty markers, recoverable autosave, atomic saves, open-recent and external
change conflicts are required. Never overwrite external work silently. Editor
data stays outside runtime staging; preserve source comments and unknown
extension data during round trips.

### Canvas and layout

Pan/zoom/fit, rulers, guides, grids, snapping, marquee/multiselect, locked/hidden
layers, breadcrumbs and isolation. Move/resize/rotate/anchor handles show exact
numbers and affected constraints. Align/distribute, group, duplicate, reorder
and reparent are undoable. Dragging edits actual constraints, not disposable
preview overrides. Independently show layout/content bounds, baselines, clips
and hit regions.

### Components, properties and vector art

Searchable library with reusable templates, instances, variants and explicit
overrides. Inspector includes layout, type, localization, bindings, focus order,
accessibility, events, materials, paths, clips and motion. Vector pen/node
editing supports line/quadratic/cubic segments, holes, fill rules, caps/joins,
stroke alignment, gradients, transforms and supported SVG import/export.
Unsupported input produces actionable diagnostics, never silent raster fallback.

### Motion and behavior

Timeline tracks by node/property, key insertion/move/delete, multi-key selection,
easing curves, scrubbing, range/loop preview, rate, labels and event markers.
State graphs expose transitions/input ownership. Preview invokes named events,
changes state variables, expands localization and loads recorded gameplay
fixtures. These are internal application events, not OS input injection. Show
which binding/animation owns a value and why a node is hidden/disabled.

### Preview and diagnostics

Presets for 4:3, 16:9, 16:10, 21:9, 32:9, Steam Deck and touch; custom output
dimensions, DPI, UI/text scale and safe areas. Compare states side by side.
Capture exact engine render targets to files, never OS screen grabs. Hot reload
preserves useful selection/state and the last valid document during syntax
errors. Diagnostics link to source/node/property and cover localization,
overflow, contrast, inaccessible controls, bitmap exceptions, draw counts,
tessellation/cache cost and texture memory.

### Delivery gate

Demonstrate a full round trip: open a translated screen, alter layout and a
vector path, edit a transition, add a localized control/binding, save, reopen,
package and run in SP and MP. Demonstrate undo/redo and external-change recovery.
A property table or web mockup with separate rendering is not this editor.

## 11. Qualification and completion

Maintain a machine-readable inventory of every effective GUI, include, widget,
script/event, material and bitmap exception. Entries record replacements,
behavior fixtures, dependencies and evidence. Require zero unclassified or
silently skipped resources. Conversion success alone proves neither visual
nor behavioral equivalence.

Use windowed engine screenshots on OpenGL/Vulkan at 720p, 1080p, 4K;
100/125/150/200% DPI; representative 4:3, 16:10, 21:9, 32:9;
100/150/200% text scale; and all supported languages. Use a documented covering
matrix and targeted extremes rather than an unexamined Cartesian product.
Validate monitor changes, viewport offsets, fractional strokes, pointer mapping
and IME. Test motion at 30/60/144/240 Hz, interruption and pause using measured
samples and visual captures. OS input control requires specific user permission.

For each translated stock screen, compare the replacement with the stock GUI at
the same 4:3 output. Plate bands, cuts, markers, rails, baselines and band
silhouettes agree within 1.5 dp; flat fills agree within 2/255 per channel
away from edges and light layers; stock-derived timings agree within one frame
at 60 Hz. Record every deliberate departure with its section of this
specification.

Qualify every screen three times: with mouse and keyboard only, with a
controller only and with touch only. Cover each viewing profile and size class
of section 13, every controller glyph family with its confirm convention, and
device switching mid-screen. Android qualification needs physical phones and
tablets for touch targets, the touch gameplay overlay and its editor, the
input method, system Back, cutouts and suspension; an emulator or desktop GLES
run does not establish touch usability.

Gameplay covers SP HUD/scopes/vehicles/terminals/checkpoints/manual saves; MP
join/team/scoreboard/chat/buy/arena/Match Control; loading/cinematics; and editor
round trips. Follow existing Linux/macOS/Android-GLES workflows. Missing platform
evidence remains incomplete. Dedicated builds retain functioning UI stubs.

Reject blurry furniture, fixed-size raster vectors, distorted cuts, displaced
hit targets, clipped translations, missing widget functions, generic restyling,
broken saves and mismatched editor preview. All current GUI must run through
the new system before claiming replacement complete.

## 12. Design review record

For each family/component/screen record source GUI/material identifiers,
reference state/capture, measured geometry/colors, bitmap exceptions, editable
vectors, all states, motion timing/rationale, language/scale behavior, output
captures, behavior verification and remaining gaps. Evidence includes exact
revisions. Keep retail extractions and temporary captures out of tracked source.

Cite the measured value used for every stock-derived dimension, color and
timing, either from this specification or from a newer measurement recorded
with its method. A disputed value is re-measured from the installed archives,
not estimated from a screenshot.

Stages can contain unfinished work but cannot mark it visually accepted or
rewrite this specification around its current limitations.

## 13. Modern interface direction

Sections 2–12 fix what must stay recognizably Quake 4. This section defines
how the replacement behaves as a current game interface on every device openQ4
targets: desktop monitors, televisions, Steam Deck and other handheld PCs, and
Android phones and tablets. Mouse and keyboard, controller and touch are equal
primary inputs. Everything added here that the stock never had is drawn in the
stock vocabulary, and ART-002's rejection of generic web, pill, card, neon and
blur restyling applies to every new pattern.

### 13.1 Principles

1. **Stock identity, current behavior.** Keep every recognition trait and add
   capability in the same vocabulary: a prompt bar is a band segment, a filter
   tag is a small cut plate, an on/off setting is a cycling value.
2. **Every input is primary.** Each screen is complete with mouse and keyboard
   alone, a controller alone, or touch alone. Controllers never steer a cursor
   through menus, and touch never depends on hover (INP-001).
3. **One visible focus.** While a controller or keyboard is in use, exactly one
   control holds focus, and the prompt bar and detail area explain it.
4. **Adapt, don't shrink.** Layout reflows by size class and viewing distance.
   A desktop composition is never scaled down to fit a phone.
5. **Immediate and interruptible.** Input changes the interface in the next
   presented frame; transitions retarget instead of blocking.
6. **Nothing is lost.** Focus, scroll position, selection and unfinished edits
   survive navigation, device switches, resizing, suspension and resumption.
7. **Accessible by default.** Remapping, size, contrast, motion and
   color-independent cues are available from the first launch.
8. **Quiet at rest.** Light and motion mark change and focus. Ambient motion
   stays subtle and can be turned off.

### 13.2 Viewing profiles

A viewing profile sets the defaults for scale, target size and presentation.
openQ4 chooses one at startup from `com_platformProfile`, host signals and the
display, and players can change it under Interface settings. Players' own UI
and text scale choices always override the profile defaults.

| Profile | Devices | Viewing distance | Primary input | UI / text scale | Minimum target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Desk | Monitors, laptops, ChromeOS windows | 50–80 cm | Mouse and keyboard | 100% / 100% | 36 dp |
| Couch | Televisions, Steam Big Picture | 2–3 m | Controller | 150% / 125% | Focus-driven; 44 dp rows |
| Handheld | Steam Deck and similar PCs | 30–40 cm | Controller, touch | 125% / 100% | 48 dp for touch |
| Phone | Android phones in landscape | 25–35 cm | Touch, controller | 100% / 100% at native density | 48 dp |
| Tablet | Android tablets and foldables | 35–50 cm | Touch, controller, keyboard | 100% / 100% at native density | 48 dp |

These defaults keep the 17 dp body em within roughly 22–31 arc-minutes of
visual angle on every profile. On Android, 1 dp follows the platform's
density-independent pixel, so a phone renders the type ramp at its own density
rather than at a desktop scale, and the text size starts from the system font
scale within the supported 100–200% range. Root-menu fitting never reduces a
touch profile below its default density to reach a 640x480 dp area; the
compact layouts below need only 640x360 dp. Couch adds a screen-edge inset of
0–5%, set against a calibration frame, for televisions that crop the picture.
An Android device connected to a television can choose the Couch profile.

### 13.3 Size classes and adaptive structure

Size classes are evaluated on the safe area in dp after UI scale, in this
order. They refine the compact presentation in section 3.

| Class | Condition | Structure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Compact height | Height below 600 dp and width at least 720 dp | Phones in landscape and short windows. A navigation rail on the leading edge, the content column, and a detail column when the width reaches 840 dp. The top band stays within 40 dp and the bottom band within 56 dp |
| Compact width | Width below 960 dp | One content column. Navigation becomes a tab strip in the top band; details expand in place |
| Regular | Width 960–1439 dp | Navigation column and content column; details appear under the focused row or in the prompt band |
| Expanded | Width 1440 dp and above | Navigation, content (forms within 1440 dp) and a trailing detail column |

Compact layouts keep both framing-band states and the stock choreography, but
limit band depth as stated; notches, risers and steps keep their measured
dimensions and move only by the smaller distance between the compact states.

Essential content, text and targets stay inside the platform's window safe
area. Bands, backdrop and imagery extend full-bleed under display cutouts,
rounded corners and system bars. Swipe-driven controls keep 24 dp clear of the
screen edges so they never compete with the system's back and home gestures.
Folding, multi-window and orientation changes are ordinary resizes under
section 3 and preserve state.

### 13.4 Input model, prompts and details

**Modality.** The most recent input device sets the presentation: hover and a
pointer for mouse, focus and glyph prompts for controller and keyboard, press
feedback and larger action plates for touch. Switching is immediate and never
moves focus or drops an edit. Moving the mouse shows hover without clearing
controller focus; the next navigation input resumes from the focused control.

**Focus.** Initial focus goes to the screen's primary action, or to the control
that held focus when the screen was last left. Each container remembers its
last focus, and a modal contains focus and returns it to its invoker. Focus
never lands on a hidden, disabled or clipped control. Navigation is spatial by
default, with authored overrides where geometry misleads. Menus of up to seven
items and tab strips wrap; scrolling lists do not.

**Prompt bar.** The bottom band's raised trailing section, where the stock Back
action sits, becomes the prompt bar. It lists the actions the focused control
accepts as a glyph and a verb. Back stays in the stock Back position at the
trailing end, the primary action sits beside it, and contextual actions lead.
The bar updates in the same frame as focus, hides actions that cannot run and
shows at most five; further actions move behind a More action. Glyphs follow
the active device: controller buttons, keycaps for the keyboard, clickable
plates for the mouse, and 48 dp tappable plates for touch.

**Detail area.** Every setting, list row and action can explain itself: a
description, current and default values, consequences such as a required
restart or a performance cost, a preview, and the reason an unavailable action
is refused. Expanded layouts dock the detail area at the trailing edge using
the card construction, regular layouts place it under the content, and compact
layouts expand it in place. It replaces stock hover cards and tooltips for
controller and touch users.

### 13.5 Controller

Actions map to button positions:

| Control | Menu action |
| --- | --- |
| South face button | Accept |
| East face button | Back; closes popups and menus |
| West face button | Secondary: reset to default, remove, refresh |
| North face button | Tertiary: details, search, sort, filters |
| Left and right bumpers | Previous and next tab or category |
| Left and right triggers | Page up and down in lists; coarse slider steps |
| D-pad, left stick | Move focus; left and right change the focused value |
| Right stick | Scroll the detail area; rotate model previews |
| Menu button | Pause from play; Apply on a screen with pending changes; otherwise close the menus and resume |
| View button | Scoreboard in multiplayer; show or hide details in menus |

Prompts draw the label printed at each position, as SDL reports it.
Nintendo-layout controllers default to confirming on the east button, and a
Swap Confirm and Back setting overrides any default. Glyph sets cover Xbox,
PlayStation, Nintendo, Steam Deck and generic controllers. They are vector
symbols in the family text color, whose shape and letter carry the identity;
keyboard keycaps are small plates with a 45-degree cut. The glyph family
follows the controller SDL reports, the `steamdeck` platform profile selects
Steam Deck glyphs for the built-in controls, and a Prompt Style setting forces
a family when a remapping layer hides the real device. Rear paddles and extra
buttons are bindable for play; no menu requires them.

**Values.** Left and right step a cycling value; Accept opens the full list
when it has more than seven choices. Sliders step with left and right,
accelerate after the navigation repeat delay, jump ten steps with the
triggers, and open exact numeric entry on Accept. Accept toggles an on/off
value. Binding capture starts on Accept and takes the next input; holding
Back for one second cancels, so Back itself can be bound, and conflicts offer
a swap or clear (WID-007).

**Text entry.** Use the platform keyboard where the session provides one, such
as Steam on Steam Deck and in Big Picture, or the Android input method.
Otherwise openQ4 shows its own vector keyboard: a key grid in the Marine
vocabulary with the current language's layout and accented characters. The
D-pad or left stick moves, south types, west deletes, north adds a space, the
bumpers move the caret and Menu finishes. A field always scrolls clear of any
keyboard that would cover it.

**Feedback and devices.** Focus movement never vibrates. A short light pulse
marks a slider limit, a refused action or an error, scaled by the existing
rumble settings and silent when rumble is off. A controller disconnect pauses
single player behind a reconnect prompt and shows a notice in multiplayer; a
low controller battery shows a notice.

**In game.** Holding a bound button opens the weapon wheel (section 14.6): a
ring of HUD plates showing every weapon's icon and ammunition, the selection
marked with the weapon strip's orange icon and ring, and the weapon name at the
center. Either stick selects and release equips; a tap swaps to the previous
weapon; the game keeps running. The same component provides a quick-chat wheel
of localized phrases in multiplayer.
Holding View shows the scoreboard. At world terminals the crosshair stays the
terminal cursor and Fire clicks, as in the stock. While the crosshair rests on
a terminal, the interactive region under it highlights, and an optional
terminal assist slows the crosshair over interactive regions.

Menus never need a virtual cursor. Free-placement editors, such as the level
editor and the touch layout editor, may offer one on the right stick, and a
controller touchpad may drive the menu cursor when players choose
`in_touchpadMode 1`.

**Controller settings.** Draw each stick's dead zone and response curve over
its live position, trigger thresholds on live trigger bars, a gyro test
reticle and a rumble test, with presets and a southpaw preview. These present
the existing `in_joystick*`, `in_gyro*` and `in_touchpad*` settings.

### 13.6 Touch and Android

**Touch fundamentals.**

- Hit regions are at least 48 dp with 8 dp between neighbors. A plate may look
  smaller; its authored hit extension grows instead (INP-007).
- Touch-down shows the hover and focus treatment at once, plus the press inset.
  Lifting outside the target or moving more than 8 dp cancels; activation
  happens on release (INP-002).
- A 500 ms long-press opens the detail area. Lists scroll by drag with inertia,
  and at either end their rim light brightens instead of stretching the
  content. A horizontal swipe on a tab strip changes category.
- Nothing depends on hover: hover cards become the detail area, and tooltips
  appear on long-press or from an information symbol.
- Text uses the Android input method. The focused field scrolls above the
  keyboard through the SDL text input area, and the keyboard's action key
  submits.
- The system Back button or gesture is Back everywhere. In gameplay it opens
  the pause menu; it never quits without the menu's confirmation.
- Menus follow one touch at a time; the gameplay overlay tracks every finger
  independently.
- A light haptic tick on press follows the system's touch-feedback setting.
- Play is landscape-only in both orientations; no portrait layouts are provided.

**Lifecycle.** Leaving the app, or suspending a handheld, pauses single player,
mutes audio and shows the pause menu on return, never dropping the player back
into combat. Multiplayer reconnects or shows a connection-lost state. Saves,
settings drafts and edits survive backgrounding and process death. The screen
stays awake during play and cinematics, and may sleep in menus.

**First run.** A device without game data, which includes every fresh Android
install, starts with a guided setup in the Marine vocabulary, which players can
reopen from Settings:

1. Language, with a live text sample.
2. Game data: explain that the player's own Quake 4 1.4.2 data is required,
   open the system folder picker, verify the required archives against the
   [official checksums](official-pk4-checksums.md), and copy or index them with
   progress, size and time remaining. A missing language archive or optional
   archive is reported without blocking. Setup resumes after an interruption,
   and every failure names its fix: a missing archive, a wrong version or too
   little storage.
3. Controls: the touch layout preset or the detected controller, and look
   sensitivity with a live test.
4. Interface: the viewing profile and text size, with a live sample.

**Touch gameplay controls.** The default Android build has no touch gameplay
overlay, because the external Sigma Touch host cannot be distributed with GPLv3
builds (see [Android, GLES and Sigma Touch](android-build.md)). openQ4
therefore provides a first-party overlay built with this UI system:

| Control | Default placement | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Move stick | Leading half; the origin is wherever the thumb lands | Analog; an outer ring marks the run threshold |
| Look | Trailing half | Drag to turn, with sensitivity and acceleration; optional gyro |
| Fire | Trailing thumb zone, 88 dp | Hold to fire; dragging from it keeps turning while firing |
| Jump, crouch | Trailing cluster, 64 dp | Crouch holds or toggles |
| Weapon | Trailing cluster | Tap for the next weapon; hold for the weapon wheel |
| Reload, zoom | Beside Fire | Shown when the current weapon supports them |
| Pause | Top leading corner, 48 dp | Opens the pause menu |
| Scoreboard, chat | Top edge | Multiplayer only |

Controls are drawn in the Marine HUD family: stick bases as thin-railed rings,
buttons as cut plates around centered vector symbols, 35% opaque at rest and
80% with the orange marker while pressed. Play shows no labels. Controls never
cover the crosshair, and the Touch HUD preset moves readouts clear of them.
Quake 4 has no use key: as in the stock, Fire clicks the terminal region under
the crosshair.

A layout editor, reachable from Settings and the pause menu, moves, resizes
(75–150%), fades and hides each control on a snapping grid. It offers Default,
Compact and Left-handed presets and a reset, stores layouts per device and
shows labels only while editing.

**World terminals.** A tap on a terminal's projected surface within use range
activates the region under the finger through the projected ray (SUR-004). A
region within 16 dp of the finger counts as hit when no other region is closer.

**Other input on Android.** A connected controller hides the touch overlay and
switches to the controller presentation; touching the screen brings the
overlay back. A pointer device, as on ChromeOS or a tablet with a mouse,
enables hover.

**Mobile rendering.** The GLES renderer omits some desktop post effects, so no
interface element depends on them. Where scene softening is unavailable or too
costly, partial panels use a darkening scrim and vignette instead. Keep to two
full-screen blended layers on tile-based GPUs by merging the backdrop's light
band and vignette. A static menu redraws only on change, at most 30 times per
second. The Phone profile starts with ambient loops and parallax off.

### 13.7 Screen patterns

- **Title.** When a save exists, Continue leads the navigation, and its detail
  shows the levelshot, mission, difficulty and play time. SINGLE PLAYER (Mission
  and Arena), LOAD GAME, MULTIPLAYER and SETTINGS follow, and the secondary links
  stay on the plinth.
- **Pause.** Resume leads. Single player offers Save, Load, Settings, Restart
  Level, Objectives and Quit to Menu. Multiplayer offers Team or Spectate,
  Match Control, Settings and Disconnect, and never pauses the server. The
  panel sits over the softened scene (section 9).
- **Settings.** Categories are tabs switched with the bumpers or a swipe, and
  sections keep their picker. Search runs across every category when the player
  types, presses north, or taps the search symbol, and each result shows its
  category path. A modified row's leading rail turns `marine.value`; the west
  button resets the focused row to its default. Rows that need a restart carry
  a warning tag, and rows with a performance cost show a three-tick impact
  gauge drawn from the slider's tick ramp. Crosshair, HUD scale, text size,
  brightness and color-vision rows preview live. Apply and Discard live in the
  prompt bar, and display changes keep the 15-second Keep or Revert countdown.
- **Lists** (servers, saves, demos). Filters are small cut tags built like the
  header band. Sort from the column header or with north. The detail column
  shows the levelshot, players and rules; Join, Spectate and Favorite sit in
  the prompt bar; west refreshes. Empty, loading and failed states follow
  section 7.
- **Arena Campaign.** Tiers form a vertical ladder of plates. Locked tiers are
  dimmed and carry the lock symbol, boss matches use a larger plate, and the
  bumpers switch tier.
- **Match Control.** Keep its contract: unavailable actions stay visible, and
  the refusal reason shows in the detail area. The bumpers move between
  sections, and destructive actions use the stock modal.
- **Demo playback.** Controls sit in the bottom band and hide after 3 s without
  input. The timeline is a progress bar with round markers. On a controller,
  south pauses, the triggers skip 10 s, the bumpers skip 30 s, north changes
  camera, west hides the overlay and east leaves. On touch, a tap shows or
  hides the controls and the timeline drags.
- **Loading.** The level name and levelshot lead; localized tips run in the
  bottom band; the continue prompt shows the active device's glyph, or "Tap to
  continue" on touch.
- **Notices.** Short notices appear in the top band's trailing section: a
  controller disconnect, a low battery, match events. They never cover the
  crosshair or touch controls, and unresolved errors persist.

### 13.8 Visual refinements

- **Depth.** The backdrop, light, grid and frame layers may shift by up to 6 dp
  with the pointer, the right stick or device tilt. Content never moves.
  Reduced motion disables the shift, and the Phone profile starts with it off.
- **Focus light.** The focused plate gains a soft additive glow in
  `marine.glow`, about 24 dp across, beside its focus rail. High-contrast mode
  replaces the glow with a solid rail.
- **Title continuity.** Activating a navigation item carries its label into the
  screen-title slot, where it becomes the path title, within the stock
  choreography timings.
- **Symbols.** Extend the vector set in the stock drawing style (1.5 dp strokes,
  45-degree terminations): search, filter, refresh, information, reset,
  restart, warning, controller, keyboard, touch, gyro, battery, lock, star and
  segmented network-quality bars.
- **Tags.** Modified, Restart, New and Locked are small header-band plates,
  never pills.
- **Color vision.** Offer alternative team and item palettes, such as a blue
  and orange team pair, and always pair team color with emblems and shape.
- **Dynamic range.** Menus and the HUD composite in standard range after tone
  mapping; openQ4's HDR path is scene-only. If display HDR output is added, the
  interface renders at a player-set paper-white level with additive light
  capped relative to it.

### 13.9 HUD presets

| Preset | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| Classic | The stock layout, shear and palette |
| Remastered | The stock elements anchored to the safe area, scalable, with vector symbols |
| Minimal | Health, armor, ammunition and crosshair only |
| Competitive | Multiplayer: enlarged readouts, match timer and team status |
| Touch | Readouts moved clear of the touch controls and enlarged |

HUD settings cover an independent HUD scale, the safe inset, opacity, color
vision, the crosshair editor (the stock set of twenty, the five stock sizes
from 24 to 72 dp and sizes between, free color with eight presets, live
preview), hit markers in multiplayer, the damage direction indicator, pickup
messages and the weapon strip. Couch and Handheld raise the default HUD scale.
Section 14 defines each element.

### 13.10 Accessibility baseline

- Remap every action for keyboard and mouse, controller and touch; offer hold
  or toggle for crouch and zoom.
- Subtitles and captions with size, background opacity and speaker names,
  placed in the cinematic picture area.
- UI scale, text size, high contrast and the text-backing option in Interface
  settings; `gui_textBackground` is console-only today.
- Reduced motion (section 8), plus reduced flashing and camera-shake strength
  where the game provides them.
- The color-vision palettes above.
- A separate interface volume and mono audio.
- A semantic label and role on every control, so platforms that offer
  text-to-speech can read menus.
- No menu timeouts except the display confirmation countdown, which shows the
  time left and accepts Keep from any input device.

### 13.11 Performance and power

Interface CPU and GPU work each stay within the budgets in the
[product completion plan](plans/ui-product-completion.md): 10% of the target
frame interval at p95 and 20% at p99 on the selected support tier. On phones
and tablets the target interval is the device's refresh rate while playing and
30 Hz for a static menu. Warm screens never retessellate unchanged paths or
rebuild unchanged text. Transitions do not allocate whole documents. Thermal
throttling reduces ambient effects before it reduces responsiveness.

### 13.12 Classic and Remastered layouts

Remastered, described in this section, is the default layout. Classic keeps
the stock composition, choreography and density of the Marine menus, and is
the same reconstruction that section 11 compares against the stock. Both share
components, tokens and the input model, so Classic still has focus, prompts
and touch targets. Touch-first profiles always use Remastered compact layouts.
Players choose the layout under Interface settings.

### 13.13 Modern components

Each component below is new to openQ4. It is built from the stock parts: cut
plates, header bands, markers, the card and modal constructions, the value
color and the tick ramp. It never introduces a construction of its own.

| Component | Construction | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Notice | A header-band plate in the top band's trailing section, 320–480 dp wide: status symbol, Lowpixel 14 dp text, optional action glyph | Enters with `notice.enter` and holds 4 s, or 8 s when it offers an action, then leaves with `notice.leave`. Errors and unresolved states persist until resolved. At most three stack downward, newest first; further notices queue. Never covers the crosshair, the touch controls or the prompt bar |
| Search | A recessed text field with the search symbol in its leading slot; results are list rows with their category path, such as `SYSTEM - DISPLAY`, in `text.heading` | Results update with every keystroke and match labels, values and language-table synonyms. Accept moves to the setting, and its plate brightens once with `value.change`. An empty search names what was searched |
| Filter tag | A small header-band plate with a close cross; set tags rest at 0.60, unset tags at 0.28 | Accept toggles. The prompt bar offers Clear filters while any tag is set |
| Countdown confirmation | The modal with a tick ramp under the body that loses one tick per second, and the remaining seconds in `marine.value` | Display changes use 15 s. Keep leads and Revert trails; timing out reverts. Accept from any device keeps |
| Binding conflict | The modal naming the action that already holds the input, with its category path | Swap, Clear the other binding, or Cancel. Cancel restores the capture state |
| Transfer progress | The progress bar with the transferred size, rate and time remaining in Profont 13 dp | First-run data setup and downloads. Pausing, suspension and restarts keep progress |
| Network quality | Four bars rising like slider ticks, colored by the worse of ping and loss, beside the ping in ms | Four bars to 60 ms, three to 120 ms, two to 200 ms, one above; each 2% of loss removes a bar. Server rows, the scoreboard and the Competitive HUD |
| Device status | The controller symbol with a three-cell battery | Shown when the platform reports the charge; a notice at 10% |
| More actions | A popover of the actions the prompt bar cannot show, each with its glyph | Opens from the More prompt; Back closes it |
| Undo | A notice with an Undo action after a reversible reset or removal | Offered for 8 s. Deleting a save still uses the confirmation modal |
| Empty state | A section heading, one Lowpixel sentence saying why the list is empty, and an action row that fixes it | For example, no saved games offers New game |
| Loading rows | Row plates at rest opacity without labels | Content replaces them with `row.reveal`. No shimmer sweep and no spinner over content |
| Crosshair editor | A live preview over a captured scene tile, the stock crosshair set in a grid, a size slider (24–72 dp: the five stock sizes and steps between), eight colors as small cut squares, and opacity and hit-marker values | Section 13.9 |
| Stick response | A plot of the dead-zone disc, the outer threshold ring, the response curve and the live stick position | Section 13.5 controller settings |
| Palette preview | Team colors and the item color code shown side by side under the selected color-vision palette | Section 13.8 |
| Text backing | An opaque local plate in the text's own row shape, black at 0.85 | The accessibility backing option |

Notices, popovers and the wheel have motion tokens in section 8. Every
component takes focus, prompts and touch targets from sections 13.4–13.6.

### 13.14 Patterns to avoid

- Storefront, advertising or engagement patterns; nagging dialogs.
- Generic platform components: rounded cards, floating action buttons, pill
  chips, toggle switches or bottom sheets with rounded corners.
- Emoji or font glyphs standing in for symbols.
- Gestures without a visible alternative.
- A controller-driven cursor in menus.
- Portrait layouts.

## 14. HUD and in-game overlays

The HUD is its own family (section 2). It never borrows the menu's 45-degree
plates: its stock construction is rounded plates, sheared gauges and bevelled
fills. This section records the stock HUD and defines how openQ4 lays it out,
extends it and keeps it legible.

### 14.1 Composition and order

The game draws the weapon's scope display first, then the crosshair, then the
HUD, then the multiplayer HUD and its overlays. A vehicle's own display
replaces the HUD while the crosshair stays. The objectives display hides the
HUD, the crosshair and any vehicle HUD but not a zoomed scope, and an objective
notice also hides a vehicle HUD; the held scoreboard hides the whole HUD,
crosshair included. The HUD runs on real time and keeps animating while the
game is paused; the objectives display and the weapon displays run on game
time.

Shear and rotation pivot on each element's own rectangle center, and an
element's transform replaces its container's instead of composing with it
(section 6). Gauge plates and numerals carry the 0.22 shear; icons and weapon
renders stay upright.

### 14.2 Stock layout

Positions are source units on the 4:3 canvas.

| Element | Rect (u) | Shown |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ammo gauge | 13,420 125x59 | Always |
| Health gauge | 190,420 125x59 | Always |
| Armor gauge | 326,420 125x59 | While armor is above zero |
| Weapon strip | Slots at y 370–396 centered on x 320; name box y 392–432 | For 1000 ms after a weapon change; hidden at once when the player fires |
| Pickup message | 21,401 230x24 | For 3000 ms after a pickup; the next pickup replaces it |
| Radio chatter | x 468–633, y 5–52 | While a transmission plays |
| Obituaries (multiplayer) | 351,5 284x70 | Four lines, two in Tourney |
| Powerups and carried flag (multiplayer) | Trailing column, x 557–641, y 260–474 | Per powerup |
| Boss bar | Plate x 227–413, y 42–89; 20 u toward the trailing side in a vehicle | During boss fights |
| Exit, quicksave and mission-failed notices | Top center and center | Timed |
| Hit indicator | Full canvas, rotated about its center | For 600 ms after each hit |
| Interactive brackets | The focused world GUI's projected bounds plus 10 u | While a world GUI has focus |
| New-objective notice | x 0–247, y 31–208 | For 2.1–5.1 s |
| Objective-complete notice | x 390–640, y 53–119, below the radio | For 2.1–5.1 s |
| Objectives display | The leading 45%, centered vertically | While the scores button is held |

The ammo gauge stands apart from the health and armor pair: the gaps are 52 u
and 11 u. The Strogg HUD places its 129x67 u gauges at 10, 190 and 330 u on
y 419.

### 14.3 Gauges

- **Fill.** The fill is anchored at its trailing end and drains toward the
  numerals. The drained part stays visible as the track, the same art at 20%.
  Below about 23% only the band above the notch remains.
- **Ammo.** For a weapon with a clip of two or more, the clip count is large
  (Chain 36 dp), the reserve small (Chain 23 dp), and the fill shows the clip.
  Otherwise the total shows alone and the fill shows it against the maximum.
  Weapons with unlimited ammunition show no number and a full fill. The
  weapon's shaded render sits behind the clip count at #C7BD78, 0.40.
  Multiplayer always shows the total and tints the ammo fill in the weapon's
  color at 20% and 50%.
- **Numerals.** Chain, aligned to a fixed trailing edge. Stock Chain digits are
  proportional, so the leading edge moves as digits change; Remastered uses
  tabular figures, and Classic keeps the stock digits.
- **Gains.** A rising value pops its numeral to 120% in white, settling to 100%
  and the readout color over 250 ms, and its icon flashes white. Damage never
  animates a gauge; it drives the hit indicator.
- **Low health.** Below 26% of maximum health (25% on the Strogg HUD) the
  health track and fill switch at once to #FF4C00, and an additive rim along the
  inside of the backing pulses its red between 100% and 50% at 2 Hz. Recovery
  restores everything at once.
- **EKG.** A trace added through the fill's own outline, beneath the fill: two
  beats per width moving toward the trailing edge at 37.5 dp/s (24 beats a
  minute), #161B0E, and #4C0D00 at low health. It is an instrument, so reduced
  motion keeps it moving.

### 14.4 Remastered anchoring

- **Anchor groups.** The gauges anchor to the bottom-leading safe corner with
  their stock spacing; the weapon strip to the bottom center; the pickup message
  above the gauges; radio chatter, the kill feed and notices to the top-trailing
  corner, with the objective-complete notice below the radio; the new-objective
  notice to the top-leading corner and the objectives display to the leading
  edge; powerups and the carried flag to the trailing edge; the boss bar and
  timed notices to the top center. The crosshair, hit indicator and brackets
  stay on the true projection center.
- **Scale and inset.** HUD scale runs 50–200% independently of the menus, and
  Couch and Handheld start at 125%. The player sets a safe inset of 0–10%.
  Elements keep their stock shape and shear at every scale; nothing stretches.
- **Classic.** The Classic preset keeps the stock 4:3 rectangles centered in the
  canvas.

### 14.5 Weapon strip

The stock strip lists the owned weapons in slot order with no gaps: blaster
(gauntlet in multiplayer), machinegun, shotgun, hyperblaster, grenade launcher,
nailgun, rocket launcher, railgun, lightning gun, dark matter gun and napalm
launcher. Each 24.4 u plate sits on a 30 u pitch, black at 0.50 and sheared about
its own center, with an upright 18 u icon. The pending weapon's icon turns
#FF8000 inside a hard 1.6 u #B2CC80 ring, a closed outline the HUD uses although
the menus never do; the other icons are #A8A360 at 60%. A weapon without
ammunition keeps the dim icon under a red prohibition sign. The weapon name,
Marine 0.25 in #B0C891, is centered below. The strip appears in the frame of the
change without motion and needs no redesign; the wheel adds a second way to
choose.

### 14.6 Weapon wheel

The wheel is an openQ4 addition for controller and touch play (section 13.5).
It speaks the weapon strip's language in a ring: HUD plates with rounded 2 dp
corners and no 45-degree cuts, the strip's selection ring and colors, and the
weapon color code.

| Measure | Value at 100% HUD scale |
| --- | --- |
| Ring | Inner radius 104 dp, outer radius 232 dp, centered on the projection center |
| Slots | Every weapon of the game mode in strip order, clockwise from the top. Unlike the compacted strip, positions never move: an unowned weapon keeps its segment as an outline at 0.15 and cannot be selected |
| Segment | Black at 0.50 with 2 dp corner radii and 6 dp gaps of constant width |
| Contents | The HUD icon at the family's icon color and 60%, the weapon number in Lowpixel 13 dp at the inner edge, the reserve in Chain 20 dp, and an ammunition arc along the outer edge in the weapon's color code, as long as the reserve is full |
| Selected | The icon turns the family's selected color (#FF8000; Strogg #FFCC00) and the strip's ring outlines the segment, 2.4 dp of #B2CC80 (Strogg #F2AD0B); the backing rises to 0.70 and the segment extends 8 dp outward |
| Previous weapon | A notch on the inner edge marks the weapon a tap returns to |
| No ammunition | The dim icon under the red prohibition sign. Releasing on it keeps the current weapon and gives the refusal feedback of section 13.5 |
| Center | The weapon name in Marine 20 dp and #B0C891, ammunition as `clip / reserve` in Chain 24 dp, and a pointer on the inner ring toward the selection |
| Backing | A black radial wash at 0.35 out to 280 dp; no blur |

**Selection.** A stick selects the segment under its angle beyond 35%
deflection, with 4 degrees of hysteresis at boundaries; inside the dead zone
the selection holds. The mouse moves an invisible selector from the center and
selects once it passes 32 dp. On touch the drag starts at the weapon button.
Releasing equips the selection; Back, or the wheel button pressed again,
closes without switching. A tap shorter than 180 ms swaps to the previous weapon
without opening the wheel.

**Motion and sound.** The wheel opens after the 180 ms hold with `wheel.open`
and closes with `wheel.close`; reduced motion keeps only the opacity change.
Selection is silent, and equipping plays the stock weapon-switch sound. The
game keeps running, and multiplayer is never slowed.

**Quick chat.** The same component with up to eight localized phrases in
Lowpixel 16 dp instead of icons. The center names the channel, All or Team,
and releasing sends the phrase.

**Strogg HUD.** On the Strogg HUD the wheel takes the Strogg construction, not
a recolored Marine ring. Each segment is an angular plate: a raised leading
tooth with 30-degree shoulders, a chamfered trailing corner and a notched inner
edge, all straight-edged. The ring twists 4 degrees backward, the polar form of
the Strogg shear. Reserve shows as eight slanted cells along the outer edge in
#FF9000, and a masked grain layer drifts over the plates like the gauges'
static. The core is an octagonal plate with a lower tab, after the boss bar,
circled by two dashed rings that turn at the Strogg terminals' 0.2 and 0.5
turns a second in opposite directions; thin circuit paths join the core to
every owned plate and brighten for the selection. Text is R_Strogg, and the
weapon name decodes from Strogg runes whenever the selection changes: the rune
line fades while the name wipes open from the center over 240 ms, a short form
of the credits' decode reveal. Colors follow the Strogg strip: icons #F59512 at
60%, the selection #FFCC00 in a #F2AD0B ring, readouts #FCFFC8. Reduced motion
stops the rings and grain and changes the name at once.

### 14.7 Crosshair and hit feedback

- **Crosshairs.** Every weapon has a default crosshair. The custom set cycles
  twenty: the eight weapon crosshairs, ten simple rings, dots and crosses,
  and the gauntlet and napalm marks. Size is 16, 24, 32, 40 or 48 u (24–72 dp),
  and color is free, white by default. openQ4 keeps the set and the five sizes,
  and the Remastered editor adds sizes between them and eight color presets
  (section 13.13).
- **Hit feedback.** On every hit the stock crosshair grows 10 u and returns over
  150 ms; single player also tints it red for 100 ms, and multiplayer plays a hit
  sound. openQ4 keeps this and adds optional multiplayer hit markers: four 6 dp
  diagonal ticks 12 dp from the center, white for a hit and `status.error` for a
  kill, for 150 ms. Classic leaves them off.
- **Damage direction.** The stock hit indicator is a soft #FF1A1A dome of light
  about 227 dp from the center, rotated toward the damage source, fading from
  0.70 to zero over 500 ms. openQ4 scales it with the HUD, caps it at 0.40 under
  the reduced-flashing option, and adds a chevron at its peak so direction never
  depends on color.
- **Context states.** Use, talk, world-GUI, vehicle, locked and friendly
  crosshairs keep their stock art, color and short size animations.

### 14.8 Messages and notices

- **Pickups.** The stock shows one line: a rounded black 0.50 bar, the item
  icon and its name in Marine 14 dp, for 3000 ms, replaced by the next pickup.
  Remastered stacks up to three lines, newest at the bottom, and merges repeats
  into one line with a count.
- **Objectives.** The objective notices and the objectives display are
  section 14.11.
- **Radio chatter.** "Incoming" and "transmission" in Marine 0.20 on a rounded
  bar, with an additive #FF8000 waveform scrolling toward the leading edge.
- **Timed notices.** EXIT under a chevron that rises 11 u with `accel(500, 500)`
  while fading from 0.50, for 5000 ms; "Game Saved..." for 2000 ms, fading over
  1000 ms (the stock drew two copies on foot; openQ4 draws one). The HUD's
  "Mission Failed" sequence has no stock sender (section 14.11).
- **Interactive brackets.** Open #AFDE90 brackets around the focused world GUI,
  labelled "Interactive"; the terminal highlight of section 13.5 uses them.
- **Subtitles.** The stock has none. openQ4 subtitles use Lowpixel 17 dp in
  white on a text backing at 0.60, with the speaker's name in #B0C891, at most two
  lines in the lower third of the cinematic picture area, and never cover the
  crosshair.

### 14.9 Multiplayer HUD

The multiplayer HUD draws over the gauges. A free-flying spectator sees it
without the gauges, kill feed or powerups; a following spectator sees the
followed player's HUD.

| Element | Modes | Stock construction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Leader and own rows | Deathmatch | Two 242x28 u slabs at the top-leading corner, black fading to a faint cut that leans with the 0.22 shear at 70–73% of the width, each with a #FFFF8D band at 0.40 with bright rims; rank, name and score in Lowpixel 0.22 with a drop shadow. Row 1 is the leader; row 2 is you, or second place when you lead or spectate |
| Timer | All | A #FFFF8D stopwatch and the time in Lowpixel 0.25 below the rows or panels, counting down M:SS; ∞ when untimed and in warm-up, sudden death and review; "Warmup N" ("Pre-game N" in Tourney) during the countdown |
| Team panels | Team modes | Two 102x58 u slabs in the team colors at 0.80 over black, with bright top and bottom rims fading toward the center and a sheared cut; faction mark and score in Lowpixel 0.36 without a shadow; your team always on top |
| Flags | Capture the Flag, Arena CTF | 28 u team flags sheared 0.22 beside the panels; "!" when taken, pulsing 28–34 u once a second, "?" when dropped |
| One flag | One-flag CTF | A neutral #FFFF8D flag joined to both panels by a gray arc; when taken it pulses and its color swings to the carrier's team |
| Dead Zone | Dead Zone | Team panels whose score flashes white to the team color on every control tick |
| Tourney | Tourney | A bracket strip across the top (8, 4, 2 and 1 cells), a black 0.60 message bar with a 45-degree end, and round banners that slide 34 u in, hold and slide out over 500 ms; your arena aqua #5EB987 at 0.40, a finished arena blue #3E57B7 settling from 1.00 to 0.40 |
| Kill feed | All | Top-trailing, four lines (two in Tourney, own arena): attacker, a Quad mark when it applies, the weapon icon at 16.5 dp in the weapon color code, then the victim; a skull for suicides and world deaths, a swirl for telefrags; team modes color the names #AAE355 and #FF8E00. The top line holds 2000 ms and fades over 1000 ms, and lines leave one every 3.1 s |
| Notices | All | The frag notice ("You fragged …") in Lowpixel 0.36 at 81 u and the main notice (rank, warm-up, sudden death, flag events) in 0.32 at 102 u, #FFFF8D, centered; 2000 ms hold, 500 ms fade |
| Spectator and warm-up text | All but Tourney | Two centered #FFFF8C lines at 123 and 141 u, breathing over 900 ms: follow status and cycle keys, ready reasons, "STARTING GAME IN N" |
| Chat | All | Four lines above the gauges at the bottom-leading corner, Lowpixel 0.25 #FFFF8D; team chat colors the channel and the text; long messages wrap into further lines |
| Aim text | All | The aimed player's name and clan 20 u below the crosshair, with a teammate's health and armor; in over 200 ms after 100 ms, out over 500 ms |
| Awards | All | The earned medal repeated once per time earned, up to nine (then one medal and a count), centered at 143–175 u; 2500 ms hold, 500 ms fade, queued 3 s apart |
| Vote | All | The call and up to six field lines at the leading edge with the Yes and No keys; after voting, the tally replaces the prompt |
| Voice | All | "Transmitting..." or the talker's name on black bars with a waveform |
| Statistics | All | Held on a key: kills, deaths, per-weapon accuracy and award counts on a soft backing at the trailing edge |
| Chat input | All | "SEND" in Marine over a dark plate at 0.80 with #FFFF8D entry text; all and team chat look the same |

Stock script slips that openQ4 does not reproduce: the Marine viewer's dropped
Strogg flag that keeps pulsing, the warm-up banner that grows from a corner
instead of sliding, and a stuck completion notice (section 14.11).

**Remastered additions.** The stock lacks these; they use its vocabulary.

- **You, marked without color.** Kill-feed and chat lines that involve you sit
  on a header-band plate at 0.30 with your name in white; your deathmatch row
  and scoreboard row carry the ◥ marker.
- **Chat input.** The input shows ALL or TEAM in the channel's color as a small
  tag before the entry, and a controller or touch player gets the platform or
  on-screen keyboard (section 13.5).
- **Respawn.** While dead, "Respawn" with the active device's glyph centered in
  the lower third, and a countdown when the server delays respawning.
- **Carrier and control.** The flag status names the carrier under the flag;
  Dead Zone shows which team holds the zone.
- **Connection.** When the connection lags, the network symbol and the ping
  appear as a notice (section 13.13); Competitive shows network quality at all
  times.
- **Warm-up and votes.** Warm-up text adds the ready count ("Ready 3/8"); a vote
  shows its remaining time as a tick ramp and the Yes and No tallies as cells,
  with the active device's glyphs.

### 14.10 Alarms and motion

| Loop | Measured | Reduced motion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low-health rim | Red 100–50% at 2 Hz | Steady at 100% |
| Missile warning | 70–30% at 2.5 Hz | Steady at 70% |
| Hit indicator | 0.70 to zero over 500 ms | Kept; capped at 0.40 with reduced flashing |
| Boss shield warning | 100–50% at 2 Hz | Steady at 100% |
| Carried flag | Grows 22 to 28 u over 150 ms, back over 500 ms | Steady at 28 u |
| Flag taken | Grows 28 to 34 u over 250 ms, back over 750 ms | Steady at 34 u |
| Exit chevron | Rises 11 u with `accel(500, 500)` and fades once a second | Static |
| One-flag color | Neutral to the carrier's team over 250 ms, back over 750 ms | Steady team color |
| Dead Zone score | White to the team color on each control tick | A steady highlight for 1 s |
| Tourney arena finished | Blue 1.00 to 0.40 over 500 ms | Immediate 0.40 |
| Voice waveform | Continuous scroll | Static trace |
| Vehicle warnings | 2 Hz hull and shield, 1 Hz electric | Steady warning colors |
| Spectator text | 900 ms breathing | Steady |
| EKG | 37.5 dp/s | Kept: it is an instrument |

Every HUD alarm pairs its motion with a static cue: the color change, the
symbol or the text.

### 14.11 Objectives display

**Stock.** Holding the scores button shows the objectives display; releasing
it closes it at once, and nothing plays either way. The game keeps running
and the player keeps control. The display hides the HUD, the crosshair and any
vehicle HUD, but a zoomed weapon's scope stays.

| Part | Stock construction |
| --- | --- |
| Back bar | A black 0.80 gradient covering the leading 45% of the screen: opaque to 190 u, half at 285 u, clear by 380 u. The rest of the view is not darkened |
| Heading | ">>MISSION OBJECTIVES" in Marine 0.25, #FF8000, tracking -1, 8 u above the first entry |
| Entries | At most the three newest objectives, newest at the top, on a 143 u pitch, the whole list centered on the canvas's vertical center. Older objectives are unreachable, and completed ones leave the list |
| Entry frame | An open plate 600x112 u with a 600x20 u foot in #B0CD6B at 0.40: leading rail, a lower-leading cut through the whole foot, a bottom rail, and a fill dissolving toward the trailing side (full to 30%, gone by 56%) |
| Entry contents | The marker; the title in Lowpixel 0.20 white on one line (overflow is dropped); a 134x100 u screenshot with a 1 u black border; the description in Lowpixel 0.20 #D0DEB6 wrapping at 178 u, seven lines at most |
| Serial | "SMC MILCOMM 45B-43556-BGX7J54" in Marine 0.14, #D9E7BF at 0.25, 12 u below the last entry |
| Empty | One frame with a static screenshot and "No current mission objectives." in Lowpixel 0.31 |
| Entry motion | 0–150 ms: the back bar slides about 220 u in and fades to 0.80, frames fade to 0.50. 150–250 ms: frames settle to 0.40 while heading, text, markers and screenshots fade in. No exit animation |

The Strogg display keeps the geometry and timing with #FF9000 frames, #FF9900
markers, R_Strogg headings and a "STROGG NET" serial.

**Remastered.** The construction stays; the limits go.

- Every active objective is reachable. Three entries show at the stock pitch,
  and the list scrolls beyond them with the right stick, the wheel or a drag;
  newest stays first.
- Completed and failed objectives move to a COMPLETED section below the active
  ones: title only, at 0.40, with a check or cross symbol, newest first.
- Titles wrap to two lines and descriptions wrap without a line limit; nothing
  is dropped. The serial rises to the 13 dp type floor.
- An Objectives setting chooses hold (stock) or toggle; toggle adds a Close
  prompt. On touch the objectives symbol in the top band toggles the display.
- Reduced motion replaces the slide with an 80 ms fade.

**Notices.** ">>NEW OBJECTIVE" sits at the top-leading corner: the back bar
widens in, the frame grows from a strip (150 ms), then the heading, the title
(Lowpixel 0.20 white, two lines of 134 u) and the screenshot fade in (100 ms).
It never shows the description. ">>OBJECTIVE COMPLETE" sits at the top-trailing
corner below the radio chatter, with no screenshot. A notice samples the
player's position 2 s after it appears and closes once the player has moved
64 units from there, or after 5 s, with a 100 ms exit; new-objective notices
wait until 5 s after spawning. The stock closes only the most recent kind and
plays the completion click twice; openQ4 closes each notice on its own and plays
the click once. A notice also hides a vehicle HUD while it is up.

**Failure.** "OBJECTIVE FAILED:" in Marine 0.50 #FF0000 with the objective's
title in white below it, centered at 200–280 u, appears at once and stays while
the view fades to black over 12 s; the restart menu follows. The HUD's "Mission
Failed" sequence has no sender in the stock and is not reproduced.

### 14.12 Boss and vehicle displays

**Boss bar.** A black 0.50 elongated octagon, 185.8x43.7 u with 14.2 u
45-degree chamfers and a 35.8 u tab at the bottom center, centered at the top
(x 227–413, y 42–89 on foot; 20 u further toward the trailing side in a
vehicle). Inside, the health bar is a 146x18.7 u hexagon with 45-degree points,
bevelled in its own tint, #EA8F15 at 20% track and 35% fill, draining toward its
leading point. Two C-shaped shield brackets, 6.9 u thick with chevron points,
face each other around it in #6A8C8A at 20% and 35%, each half draining from the
center toward its outer point; below 1000 shield points they turn #FF4000 and
pulse 100–50% at 2 Hz. A white health icon at 0.20 sits over the tab. Nothing
is sheared and there are no numerals.

**Walker and hover tank.** Two gauges on the Marine gauge art without its
numeral zone: the hull, labelled ARMOR, with ten cells, and SHIELDS, labels in
Lowpixel 0.14 #A8A360 at 60%, trailing-anchored fills in #B3D06E. At 25% hull, or
no shield, the gauge turns #FF3300 at 60% and pulses at 2 Hz. A weapon panel
with a 26 u upper-trailing chamfer shows the current weapon's outlined
silhouette at 80% and the other at 40%, a rocket count in Chain, and an
#FF9E1A charge bar while a weapon recharges. On entry, ">>MACHINEGUN
INITIALIZED..." style lines wipe open in Marine 0.22 #FF8000 inside moving
#FF8000 brackets, turn white and fade over 5.5 s. Hits flash an additive
#550000 edge vignette out over 500 ms; electrical damage shows red curved
brackets and a lightning bolt pulsing once a second for 2.5 s. "[ Press JUMP to
exit ]", or "[ Vehicle Locked ]" in orange, sits trailing-aligned at the bottom.

**Other rides.** The flatbed and the tram replace the three gauges with a
vehicle-silhouette gauge. The air-defence cannon draws a static amber scope
overlay with two load bars and its own reticle. The Stroggification table and
the MCC body table run scripted Strogg interface sequences of hexagon flashes,
readouts and static. openQ4 keeps each source's construction and timing and
lays them out with the HUD anchor rules; vehicle labels and messages come from
the language tables.

### 14.13 Scopes and weapon displays

Scopes appear and vanish with the zoom, without fades, above everything else in
the HUD, and the field of view changes over 100 ms.

| Scope | Aperture | Marks and motion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Machinegun (and the hover tank's cannon) | A circle of radius 182 u with a 40% gray veil outside and an optical smear beyond | A black double ring, four broken posts, fine ticks near the center, and a ring of 16 dots that turns with the view's yaw like a compass |
| Railgun | A diamond, \|dx\| + \|dy\| < 362 u, black at about 86% outside, with a gray bevel | Hairlines with 108 u and 126 u gaps, #00FFFF bars at 50% beside the horizontal hair, a ring turning 40 degrees a second, three sheared #99FFFF clip cells, and a faint diamond pulse every 2 s |
| Nailgun (seeker modification only) | An amber circle of radius 255 u with four inward hooks | A ring turning with the yaw, a lock arrow pointing at the target, and R_Strogg "// LOCKED //", range and countdown readouts once locked |

Weapon displays are the gun-mounted screens of the view models.

| Weapon | Display |
| --- | --- |
| Machinegun, shotgun | Black Marine digits on a #73A640 plate with a 3 Hz shimmer; low (below 10 and 3) #CA8F15; empty #C72C1B pulsing 100–50% at 2 Hz; the shotgun adds a scan band every 2 s |
| Hyperblaster | Digits on a #85B4FA plate with a random 68–100% flicker; below 10 it pulses at 3 Hz and a RELOAD plate flashes #FE4203 |
| Nailgun | No digits: an #E8AB1F level in six slanted cells; empty turns #E63300 pulsing 100–40% at 2 Hz |
| Rocket launcher | Three #44D29D cells that go dark (#422300) as rounds are spent, 80–100% at 3 Hz |
| Railgun | Teal #009F9F charge arcs that turn orange-red for 2 s after the last shot, turning rings and scan pulses |
| Napalm launcher | Animated fire art without a readout |

The blaster, grenade launcher, lightning gun, dark matter gun and gauntlet have
no display. The machinegun and shotgun overlays' 9 Hz flicker is capped at
3 Hz (section 8), and the hyperblaster's RELOAD plate, a bitmap with baked
English, becomes a vector plate with localized text.

### 14.14 Scoreboard and match summary

**Stock scoreboard.** Held on the scores button, or forced for 5 s when a
tournament ends. It appears and disappears at once and hides the whole HUD,
crosshair included. It is not interactive.

| Part | Stock construction |
| --- | --- |
| Backing | The soft backing at black 0.60, opaque over the central 509x399 u; the Tourney board uses a flat black 0.60 fill |
| Header | Server name and address in Lowpixel 0.22 #FFFF8D |
| Panels | Your team first, then the other team, then spectators. Each opens with a header band at 1.00 in the team color (#8B964B for deathmatch and Tourney, #999999 for spectators) carrying the faction mark, MARINE, STROGG, SPECTATORS or PLAYERS in Lowpixel 0.31 and the team score; headings in Lowpixel 0.16 at 0.40 over a white 0.10 rule |
| Columns | Ready, speaker, friend and flag or rune icons; name; clan; score; kills (flag modes); minutes connected; ping, trailing-aligned |
| Rows | Lowpixel 0.22 with a drop shadow on server-list bands: every row 8%, your row 29%, eliminated Tourney players greyed. The pitch adapts to the entries, up to 16: 15–30 u in team modes, 17–35 u in deathmatch, 13–26 u in Tourney |
| Footer | A white 0.10 rule, game type and map, the frag, capture or control limit, the time limit and the timer |
| Tourney | A bracket tree of closed 1 u outlines at 0.40 (the only closed boxes in the family) joined by elbow connectors, over the players and spectators lists |

Past 16 entries the stock spills over its footer, and the local player is
marked by band brightness alone.

**Remastered scoreboard.** It stays instant and non-interactive while held.

- Your row adds the ◥ marker to the brighter band, so it never depends on
  brightness or color alone.
- Ping shows the network-quality bars and color (section 13.13) beside the
  number; a DEATHS column follows KILLS, and a line under the header reads
  "3rd of 12".
- Dead players' rows drop to 0.50 with a skull until they respawn; openQ4 bots
  carry a BOT tag in the header-band construction.
- Beyond 16 entries the rows keep the smallest pitch and the list scrolls with
  the right stick or the wheel while the board is held, with a count of the
  rows below.
- On touch, the scoreboard button at the top edge toggles it instead of
  holding.

**Match summary.** It opens at the end of the match with the cursor: SUMMARY,
STATISTICS and SCOREBOARD tabs on the tab strip, the soft backing at 0.90, and
"[ Press ESC to return to the game ]". Deathmatch lists the top ten with each
player's three most accurate weapons as icons, the first three rows tinted
blue, red and yellow at 0.15; team modes put the winning team's panel on top.
The chat history and entry follow, and STATISTICS shows each player's kills,
deaths, accuracy grid, medals and end-game awards. openQ4 fixes the stock's
report of a tied match as a Strogg win (it reads DRAW), prompts with the active
device's glyphs, and marks your row as the scoreboard does.

## Appendix A. Stock survey method

The 1.1 survey read the 30 installed `q4base` archives of the Steam 1.4.2
release in load order and took the effective copy of every path: 264 GUI files
(two of them includes), the `gfx/guis` interface art, the 12, 24 and 48 point
`.fontdat` atlases of six faces, and the material and table declarations. It
parsed every window's rectangle, background, colors, font, `textscale`,
`textspacing`, alignment, shear and rotation, and every event's transitions,
`onTime` keys and sound commands. It measured alpha and color profiles of each
furniture texture (visible bounds, cuts, rails, fades, baked rail colors),
traced the framing-band silhouettes column by column, took glyph ink from the
atlases, and read blend modes, `scroll`/`rotate` stages and `guitable_*` pulse
tables from the materials. Static composites of the stock settings page, home
screen and modal, built from the measured values, were compared against engine
captures of openQ4's current bitmap menus.

The 1.1 numbers came from one-off measurement scripts over those archives;
no extracted data is tracked. Re-measure from the installed archives when a
value is disputed, and record the method with the new value.

The 1.3 survey reread the same archives for every menu, HUD, cursor, loading
and objectives script. It resolved each screen change to absolute times,
measured the band, frame and HUD textures, and read the engine's transition,
list and window code and the 1.4.2 SDK game code for behavior the scripts do not
contain. An overlay of center-pivot gauge outlines on an openQ4 capture
confirmed the shear rule.

The 1.4 survey read the objectives, vehicle, scope and weapon-display GUIs and
the multiplayer HUD, scoreboard, summary and chat line, with the 1.4.2 SDK's
objective and multiplayer code. Static composites rendered from the retail art
and fonts checked the layouts; nothing was captured in play.

### B.2 Framing band silhouettes

Band-local source units; both band rectangles are 1045x129 u. Diagonal
segments between listed vertices are 45-degree flanks; the coordinates carry
the stock texels' rounding.

Top band inner edge (x, y): (0, 89.7), (102.1, 89.7), (116.3, 103.8),
(430.7, 103.8), (440.9, 94.7), (476.6, 94.7), (485.8, 103.8), (527.6, 103.8),

the shotgun (1, 0.55, 0), rocket launcher (1, 0.25, 0), lightning gun
(1, 1, 0.6) and dark matter gun (0.77, 0.2, 1), and adds the napalm launcher
(1, 0.75, 0.25).

### B.5 HUD textures

ART-022, FLOW-019 to FLOW-028, PERF-009 and QUAL-011 for the section 13 scope.
The register validator's revision mode audits such appends and supersessions.

### Version 1.3

Version 1.3 measures the framing-band motion, the HUD and the pop-up frames in
a second survey of the effective retail GUIs, corrects what the first survey
got wrong, and adds modern components and a HUD section.

pop-up catalogue, detailing rules, modern components and section 14 have no
rows yet. They need a register revision before these values serve as
acceptance criteria.
